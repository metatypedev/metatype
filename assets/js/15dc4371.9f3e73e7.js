Those operations are commonly used in combination with data validation to ensure that the stored data is correct and consistent.","sidebar":"useCases"},"backend-for-frontend/index":{"id":"backend-for-frontend/index","title":"Backend for frontend","description":"Backend for frontend (BFF) is an architectural pattern in which each frontend client has a dedicated backend system. It enables client-specific customization of backend APIs with data transformations and optimizes requests by pre-fetching and caching data.","sidebar":"useCases"},"faas-runner/index":{"id":"faas-runner/index","title":"Function-as-a-service runner","description":"A Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) runner is a platform that allows developers to deploy and run small, single-purpose functions in the cloud. FaaS runners typically provide a serverless architecture, which means that developers do not have to worry about infrastructure management or the scaling, as the platform automatically handles these tasks.","sidebar":"useCases"},"graphql-server/index":{"id":"graphql-server/index","title":"All-in-one GraphQL server","description":"GraphQL is a query language for APIs that was developed by Facebook in 2012 and open-sourced in 2015.

Due to the resource constraints and compatibility issues (legacy libraries or specific drivers) of those environments, running a traditional Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library might not be as easy as in normal deployments.","sidebar":"useCases"},"programmable-api-gateway/index":{"id":"programmable-api-gateway/index","title":"Programmable API gateway","description":"A programmable API gateway is an API gateway that provides a customizable framework for developers to create and deploy custom logic and policies for incoming requests and outgoing responses. Unlike traditional API gateways that provide a fixed set of features and policies, programmable API gateways offer a more flexible and extensible approach to managing APIs.","sidebar":"useCases"}}}')}}]);
