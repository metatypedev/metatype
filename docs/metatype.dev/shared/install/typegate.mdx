### Using Embedded Typegate (Recommended)

```shell
meta typegate
```

The typegate instance runs on port `7890` by default. You can check if the typegate node is running by accessing [http://localhost:7890](http://localhost:7890) in your browser.

  <summary> Using docker (Not Recommended) </summary>
  
Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and use the following `compose.yml` to launch a typegate node. For multi-instance production workloads, Redis and an S3 object store provider are required but the typegate will run using in-memory stores if no `SYNC_*` environment variable is detected. More details can be found [here](/docs/reference/typegate/synchronization). In practice you might also want to add a database or other systems that the typegate can connect to.

```yml
services:
  typegate:
    image: ghcr.io/metatypedev/typegate:latest
    ports:
      - "7890:7890"
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    environment:
      # only for dev, generate secure values for production
      TG_SECRET: "a4lNi0PbEItlFZbus1oeH/+wyIxi9uH6TpL8AIqIaMBNvp7SESmuUBbfUwC0prxhGhZqHw8vMDYZAGMhSZ4fLw=="
      TG_ADMIN_PASSWORD: password
      DEBUG: "true"
```

```bash
# launch the containers
docker compose up --detach

# watch the typegate logs
docker compose logs typegate --follow
```
