## Typegate

<Features

          <>
            Expose select functions in your graph through a GraphQL API. These
            root-functions will serve as the entry point to your graph for any
            incoming request. The typegraph model is a great fit for GraphQL
            semantics and this is the best supported way to consume typegraphs.

        body: (
          <>
            You can expose select root functions through a simple REST API. This
            is handy to serve endpoints for clients that are not GraphQl
            capable, even though it hampers access to some typegraph features.
            Inputs will be sourced from either HTTP bodies or search parameters
            according to HTTP verb.

          <>
            Expose your gRPC API, enabling high-performance, bi-directional
            communication between services. This allows you to call gRPC methods
            directly from the typegraph, providing more flexibility and better
            integration with existing gRPC-based microservices. This approach
            supports a broader range of real-time use cases .

            Rate-limit parts of your graph to minimize abuse. The limits can be
            configured granularly for each function and for custom time windows.
            Use custom request identifiers, in addition to ip addresses, to
            track limits counters.

            Specify cross-origin request rules to control which domains can
            access your API from within a browser. Prevents abuse from websites
            trying to use your API without permission.

            The typegate can be run as a single node mode for simple deployments

            development and testing.

          <>
            Deploy multiple instances of the typegate to distribute loads across
            machines and scale horizontally. You'll only need a Redis compatible
            key-value cache, an S3 compatible object store, and your favorite
            load-balancer in front of the instances to get it going. This mode
            is recommended for production deployments even if only a single node
            is used.

            Useful to validate incoming data even more and distribute invariants
            through your app.

          <>
            Injections resolve part of your graph inline instead of from
            functions or provide defaults for incoming request data. This can be
            used to set static values or source them from the context, other

            Compose functions together by feeding the output of one as the input
            of another. Encourages code reuse by allowing one to extract common
            middleware logic from each function, all within the typegraph layer.

        body: (

            <code>reduce</code> is useful to transform function input types so
            that only certain struct fields are used, discarding the others.
            Required fields can be hidden from the user and can instead be
            injected from the request's context or a static default. This is
            useful for remixing generated or core domain types to more targeted
            forms appropriate for a function.

            <code>apply</code> allows the flattening of deeply nested function
            input types to something friendlier. Injection can also be used to
            substitute required fields in the original type from another source.

        body: (
          <>
            Imports will allow graphs to include nodes from other API
            descriptions like GraphQL, OpenAPI, gRPC and database schemas. These
            APIs can then be consumed in a typesafe manner through the{" "}
            <code>GraphQL</code> and <code>Http</code> runtimes.

            First-class support for secrets to ease runtime substitution of
            sensetive values. API keys or dynamic values only discovrable after
            deployment, this is how you get them into your app.

# Features overview

- Quickly put together modern APIs that are thoroughly typed, access controlled, and unconstrained. All backed by your preferred database.

- When the project grows, you can easily introduce new APIs or break existing ones in smaller parts while keeping the same interface.

- You can write complex business logic directly in Typescript, Python or WebAssembly and run them directly inside the composition engine.

- Third-parties APIs can be easily integrated, providing you visibility and control over them.

- Metatype boundaries are easily interoperable with existing systems. Introduce it into your stack in a gradual fashion.

- When the time comes, easily switch to a multi-instance deployment and scale out.

- Metatype can be easily self-hosted or customized according to your needs.

- App frontends today are built on composable ecosystem components. Metatype envisions and is designed around a similar future for backend development.

## GraphQL APIs

- Easily expose business logic endpoints through generated [GraphQL APIs](/docs/reference/runtimes/graphql).
- Helpers to auto-generate and expose CRUD operations from your types on [myriad of databases](/docs/reference/runtimes/prisma).
- All built upon the typegraphs primitives, they compose well with every other feature and allow [granular control](/docs/reference/types/parameter-transformations) when required.
- That ideal API your frontend engineers keep asking for is never out of reach. {/*TODO: error model docs */}
- The typegraph allows for easy evolution of you API, adding or deprecating types and functions as needed.
- You can expose sections of graph through [REST endpoints](/docs/guides/rest) with ease.

## Auth

- Expressive authorization primitives through [policy based access-control](/docs/reference/policies).
- Oauth2 and JWT based [authentication](/docs/reference/typegate/authentication) ready to go.
- [Rate limit](/docs/reference/typegate/rate-limiting) your APIs or add [CORS](/docs/reference/typegate/cors) control.

## Type checking

- Everything in Metatype starts with [types](/docs/reference/types).
- Model exactly what's needed for your app with simple syntax and a modern type system.
- Bring your own abstractions when needed leveraging the "imperatively declarative" SDKs.

## Modern CLI

- The [meta-cil](/docs/reference/meta-cli) is designed to get you up and productive in no time.
- Live auto-reload, database migration management, type-checking and linting, it's all there.

## Bring your own storage

- Easy going with object file storage using the [S3Runtime](/docs/reference/runtimes/s3)
- Includes support for [GraphQL file uploads](/docs/guides/files-upload) and presigned URLs.

## Function runner

- Different runtimes are available for running the exact, turing complete, code you need.
- Code generators to get easily get your types where you need them.
- [Typescript](/docs/reference/runtimes/deno), [Python](/docs/reference/runtimes/python) and [Wasm](/docs/reference/runtimes/wasmedge) today, all industrial languages and more tomorrow (open a ticket!).
