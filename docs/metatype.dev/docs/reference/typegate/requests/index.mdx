# Requests

## Idempotency

An idempotent request is a request that always returns the same result when retried with the same input.
This is useful to prevent duplicate operations, such as charging a customer twice if a network timeout or retry occurs.

You can enforce idempotency on any request to a typegraph, you just have to set the `Idempotency-Key` header with a unique value (such as a UUID).

```curl
curl https://localhost:7890/awesome_typegraph \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ...." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: 123abc" \
  -d '{
    "query": "mutation CreatePost($title: String!) { createPost(title: $title) { id title } }",
    "variables": { "title": "My First Post" }
  }'
```

:::info Notes

- Keys expire happens after 24 hours.
- A key must match the original request exactly during its lifetime.
  - Reusing the same key for different requests will result in error status 422.
- An empty string explicitly disables idempotency, it is a no-op.
- The maximum key length is 255 characters.
