# Synchronization

<!-- The workloads can be shared accross multiple typegate instances. -->
<!-- The shared data between instances are stored in -->
<!-- a Redis database and a s3-compatible object store. -->

The typegate run in either on of the following modes:

- _Single instance mode:_ a single typegate instance runs all the workloads;
- _Synchronized mode:_ the workloads can be shared accross multiple typegate instances.

## System setup

To enable multiple typegate instance support, the system need the following services:

| Service            | Role                                                            |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Load balancer      | Share the loads accross the different typegate instances        |
| Redis database     | Used for synchronization between typegate instances             |
| S3 storage         | Store all the shared files/artifacts for the typegate instances |
| Typegate instances | _Obvious_                                                       |

### Load balancer

The setup does not require a specific load balancer software/hardware. Any load balancer can do the job.

### Redis database

A single redis instance can be shared by multiple systems, configured with different database numbers.

### S3 storage

Any S3-compatible object store is supported for the file/artifact storage.

One S3 storage might be shared by multiple systems. However, each system must be configured to use its own dedicated bucket.

### Typegate instances

The typegate instances are configured with environment variables. All the instances of the system must share the same value for the synchronization variables.

See [configuration](#typegate-configuration) for details.

## Typegate configuration

The typegate instances that at the core of the system must share the configuration variables.

Synchronization variable names start with `SYNC_`.

:::warning

- If no `SYNC_*` variable is present, the typegate will run in the default single instance mode.
- The typegate will fail to start if any of the `SYNC_*` variables is present and some required `SYNC_*` variable is missing.

| Variable                          | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SYNC*REDIS_URL (\_Required*)      | URL to the Redis database. Must include the database number. |
| SYNC*REDIS_PASSWORD (\_Optional*) | Redis database password, can be included in SYNC_REDIS_URL;  |
| SYNC*S3_HOST (\_Required*)        | Hostname of the S3 store;                                    |
| SYNC*S3_REGION (\_Required*)      | S3 region;                                                   |
| SYNC*S3_ACCESS_KEY (\_Required*)  | Access key for the S3 store credentials;                     |
| SYNC*S3_SECRET_KEY (\_Required*)  | Access key secret for the S3 store credentials;              |
| SYNC*S3_PATH_STYLE (\_Optional*)  | `true` or `false`, force path style if `true`.               |
| SYNC*S3_BUCKET (\_Required*)      | The bucket to be used for the system (dedicated).            |
