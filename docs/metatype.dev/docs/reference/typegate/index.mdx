## Internal APIs

Most of the internal APIs are still unstable, and may change without notice. If you still want to experiment with them, you can use the GraphQL introspection to discover them.

- /typegate
- /prisma-migration

The typegate nodes - or typegates - are the central components of the ecosystems. They build and type check typegraphs, and expose them through a HTTP/GraphQL interface. They enforce the type safety of the data flows, connect to all the runtimes and orchestrate the execution of incoming requests.

## Request lifecycle

When a new request fires a trigger, the typegate orchestrates the following stages:

1. extract the secure request context from custom authentication or JSON Web Token (JWT)
1. retrieve cached execution plan or compute a new one
   - traverse the typegraph to create a DAG of the required types
   - optimize the DAG to reduce the number of calls to the runtimes
   - pre-compute all structural elements and data resolutions
1. execute the plan
   - type check the arguments
   - verify lazily policies on the need
   - run the DAG execution
   - enforce the rate-limiting
   - type check the response
1. manage metadata of the request

## HTTP/GraphQL interface

For now, the typegate nodes are only accessible through HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. More protocols could be supported in the future. Typegates expose a GraphQL interface which is the result of a [typegraph](./typegraph) projected onto corresponding GraphQL types. While this reduces the type safety of the data flowing, it makes more interoperable thanks to the many high-quality and well-known GraphQL tooling already available. The underlying types are also exposed in order for API clients to verify the underlying types.

GraphQL, being a query language, offers a great asset for Metatype's philosophy:

1. Efficient querying: the client can specify exactly what data it needs, reducing the amount of over- or under-fetching
2. Flexibility: allows for retrieving multiple resources in a single request, unlike REST, which often requires multiple ones
3. Typing: GraphQL has a built-in type system that allows for better documentation and stronger validation of the requests
4. Improved tooling: tools and libraries around GraphQL are rapidly growing and great a development experience

## Configuration

### Environment variables.

The following environment variables can be used to configure the typegate. `SYNC_*` variables have special semantics which you can read about [here](/docs/reference/typegate/synchronization).
