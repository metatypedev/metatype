# Substantial

## Substantial runtime

The Substantial runtime enables the execution of durable workflows in one or accross multiple typegates.

Why use it?

- **Long-running "processes"**: Durable tasks that need to run over extended periods (days, weeks or months), handling **retries** and **restarts** seamlessly.
- **Fault-tolerant execution**: Ensure reliable execution of tasks, even upon failures, by maintaining a durable state of the latest run.
- **Task orchestration**: Coordinate complex sequences of workflows (analogous to microservices interactions).

For example, the workflow bellow will continue running until a `confirmation` event is sent to the **associated run**.

```typescript
export async function sendEmail(ctx: Context) {
  // 1. A workflow can receive parameters whose type is defined on the typegraph
  const { to } = ctx.kwargs;

  // 2. When a function call produces effects, we can make it durable
  const info = await ctx.save(() => sendSubscriptionEmail(to));
  const timeSent = await ctx.save(() => new Date().toJSON());

  const confirmation = ctx.receive<boolean>("confirmation");
  if (!confirmation) {
    throw new Error(`${to} has denied the subscription sent at ${timeSent}`);
  }

  return `${to} confirmed (${info})`;
}
```

Additionally, if we were to shut down the Typegate node executing it and then restart it, the state **will be preserved**. This means that if the subscription email was already sent, upon relaunch, it will not be sent again, same thing for the value of `timeSent`.

## Key Concepts

### Workflows

A special type of function with **durable state** and an execution mechanism directly tied to time. A workflow can also trigger other workflows (child workflows).

### Backend

This abstraction implements a set of atomic operations that allows Typegate to persist and recover the workflow state. Currently, we have the **Redis** backend available, along with others like **fs** and **memory**, which are primarily intended for development or testing purposes.

### Run

When a workflow is started, a run is created and Substantial will provide you a `run_id` to uniquely identify it.

You can send an event or abort an ongoing run from its `run_id`.

## Child workflows

Child workflows are like any other workflows, they are just run by another workflow (parent).

If a workflow parent is explicitly stopped or aborted, all of its descendants will also be aborted.

For example, suppose you want to write a workflow that sends a subscription request to a list of emails and then receive a notification for each confirmation or denial, but only during your work hours.

You can easily translate that logic as if you were writing generic sequential code using Substantial workflows.

```typescript
import {
  nextTimeWhenAdminIsAvailable,
  sendSubscriptionEmail,
  notifyAdmin,
} from "./utils.ts";

export async function sendEmail(ctx: Context) {
  // 1. A workflow can receive parameters whose type is defined on the typegraph
  const { to } = ctx.kwargs;

  // 2. When a function call produces effects, we can make it durable
  const info = await ctx.save(() => sendSubscriptionEmail(to));
  const timeSent = await ctx.save(() => new Date());

  const confirmation = ctx.receive<boolean>("confirmation");
  if (!confirmation) {
    throw new Error(`${to} has denied the subscription sent at ${timeSent}`);
  }

  // 3. In this scenario, we use a durable sleep to wait until the admin
  // is available
  const duration = await ctx.save(() =>
    nextTimeWhenAdminIsAvailable(new Date()),
  );
  ctx.sleep(duration);

  const _ = await ctx.save(() => notifyAdmin(info), {
    retry: {
      minBackoffMs: 1000,
      maxBackoffMs: 5000,
      maxRetries: 4,
    },
  });

  return `${to} confirmed`;
}

export async function sendMultipleEmails(ctx: Context) {
  const { emails } = ctx.kwargs;

  // 1. Persist the state of the child workflows
  const handlersDef = await ctx.save(async () => {
    const handlersDef = [];
    for (const email of emails) {
      const handleDef = await ctx.startChildWorkflow(sendEmail, {
        to: email,
      });
      handlersDef.push(handleDef);
    }

    return handlersDef;
  });

  // 2. Create handles for your child workflows
  const handles = handlersDef.map((def) => ctx.createWorkflowHandle(def));

  // 3. In this example, we wait on all child workflows to complete
  await ctx.ensure(async () => {
    for (const handle of handles) {
      if (!(await handle.hasStopped())) {
        return false;
      }
    }
    return true;
  });

  const ret = await ctx.save(async () => {
    const ret = [];
    for (const handle of handles) {
      const childResult = await handle.result<string>();
      ret.push(childResult);
    }

    return ret;
  });

  return ret;
}
```

In your typegraph, you will have:
