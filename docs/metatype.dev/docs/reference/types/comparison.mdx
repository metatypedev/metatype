# Type comparison

A type `A` is called a **subtype of** a type `B` if any valid value for `A` is a valid value for `B`.
This means that `B` has a broader range of values.

The _"is subtype of"_ relation between types is [partial order relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set)
equivalent to the _"is subset of"_ relation (set inclusion) if types were defined as a set of values.
Note that the reflexivity of partial orders translates to "for all type `A`, `A` is a subtype of `A`".

This type comparison is required for the validation of [_from parent_ injections](/docs/reference/types/injections#parent).

## Semantics

In this section `A` and `B` denote types, `U` and `V` denote lists of types.

If `A` is a subtype of `B`, then `A` and `B` are either both scalar types or both non-scalar types.

### Scalar types

1. If `A` is a scalar type and `A` is a subtype of `B` then
    `B` is a scalar type or a union type with at least one variant that is a supertype of `A`.

    Note that this is stricter than it should be because we _currently_ only check individually on each union variant.

1. If `A` is a subtype of `B` and `B` is a scalar type then
    `A` is a scalar type of a union type in which any variant is a subtype of `B`.

1. Suppose that `A` and `B` are scalar types.

    Then `A` is subtype of `B` if and only if the following conditions hold:

    - `A` and `B` are the same type or `A` is a `t.integer()` and `B` is a `t.float()`;

    - [Type constraints](/docs/reference/types) defined on `B` are all defined on `A` and satisfy:

        | Type | Type Constraint | Condition |
        | ---- | --------------- | --------- |
        | `t.integer()`, `t.float()` | `min` | `A.min >= B.min` |
        | `t.integer()`, `t.float()` | `x_min` | `A.x_min >= B.x_min` |
        | `t.integer()`, `t.float()` | `max` | `A.max <= B.max` |
        | `t.integer()`, `t.float()` | `x_max` | `A.x_max <= B.x_max` |
        | `t.integer()`, `t.float()` | `multiple_of` | `A.multiple_of` is a multiple of `B.multiple_of` |
        | `t.string()` | `min` | `A.min >= B.min` |
        | `t.string()` | `max` | `A.max <= B.max` |
        | `t.string()` | `pattern` | `A.pattern == B.pattern`[^pat] |
        | `t.string()` | `format` | `A.format == B.format` |
        | `t.file()` | `min` | `A.min >= B.min` |
        | `t.file()` | `max` | `A.max <= B.max` |
        | `t.file()` | `allow` | `A.allow` is a subset of `B.allow` |

        [^pat]: The patterns are required to be exactly the same
        because we currently do not have any other comparison semantic for regular expressions.

        Note that type constraints defined on `A` are not required to be defined on `B`.

    - If `B` is an enum, then `A` is an enum and all enumeration values defined for `A` are defined for `B`.

### Optionals

1. `A` is a subtype of `t.optional(B)` if and only if `A` is subtype of `B`.

2. `t.optional(A)` is a subtype of `t.optional(B)` if and only if `A` is a subtype of `B`.

3. If `B` is not an optional type, then `t.optional(A)` is not a subtype of `B`.

### Lists

1. Suppose that `A` and `B` are non-optional types and `A` is a subtype of `B`.
    If `A` is a list then `B` is a list and vice-versa.

2. Let `X` a list type whose item type is `A`, and `Y` a list type whose item type is `B`.
   `X` is a subtype of `Y` if and only if 
    - `A` is a subtype of `B`,
    - Type constraints defined on `X` are all defined on `Y` and satisfy:
        | Type constraint | Condition |
        | --------------- | --------- |
        | `min` | `X.min >= Y.min` |
        | `max` | `X.max <= Y.max` |
        | `unique_items` | `X.unique_items == Y.unique_items` |

  Note that the type constraints defined on `X` are not required to be defined on `Y`.


### Objects: `t.struct()`

1. Suppose that `A` and `B` are non-optional types and `A` is a subtype of `B`.
   If `A` is an object type then `B` is an object type, and vice-versa.

2. If `A` and `B` are object types, then
  `A` is a subtype of `B` if and only if
    - All field key defined in `A` is defined in `B`,
    - For all field defined in `B` with key _K_,
      either the field is optional on `B`
      or `A` has a field with key _K_ whose type is a subtype of the one in `B`;
    - Type constraints defined on `B` are all defined on `A` and satisfy:
        | Type constraint | Condition |
        | --------------- | --------- |
        | `min` | `A.min >= B.min` |
        | `max` | `A.max <= B.max` |

### Unions: `t.union()` and `t.either()`

1. If `A` is a type and `V` a list of types then
    `A` is a subtype of `t.union(V)` if and only if
    there is a type `B` in `V` such that `A` is a subtype of `B`.

2. If `A` is a type and `V` a list of types then
    `A` is a subtype of `t.either(V)` if and only if
    there is a unique type `B` in `V` such that `A` is a subtype of `B`.

3. If `U` is a list of types and `B` a type then
   - `t.union(U)` is a subtype of `B` if and only if
    each type `A` in `U` is a subtype of `B`;
   - `t.either(U)` is a subtype of `B` if and only if
    each type `A` in `U` is a subtype of `B`.
