## Google importers

The typegraph module comes with some handy importers to avoid having to rewrite manually all types and functions. Currently, it supports importers for OpenAPI, GraphQL API and Google APIs.

Importers are function call with a boolean re-writing the source code file where they live. As they can generate quite long type definition, the best practice is to separate them into a dedicated file that can be imported into your main typegraph. Let's create `google.py` and run `python google.py` to generate the types.

<!--<CodeBlock language="python">{require("!!code-loader!./importer.py").content}</CodeBlock>-->

This should generate code similar to this:

<!--<CodeBlock language="python">{require("!!code-loader!./google.py").content}</CodeBlock>-->

And can be imported/customized in your main typegraph file:
