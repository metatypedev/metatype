# Wasm functions

:::warning Beta

The following feature is not yet stable.

:::

The [`WasmRuntime`](/docs/reference/runtimes/wasm) enables one to use any langauge/ecosystem with a toolchain capable of producing wasm artifacts to author [custom functions](/docs/guides/external-functions). [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) is one such a language and has shaped up to be the hotspot of development in the wasm ecosystem (The Metatype itself platform has many rusty parts). In this guide, we'll see how to set up a workflow for using Rust for our custom functions.

## Tooling

We need to install several programs to be able to produce the components. The following checklist contains links to get you started:

1. Rust compiler toolchain: this guide assumes moderate familiartiy of development with rust and won't spend many words on how to get it functional. In any case, you can get started with rust [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
2. `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target for rustc: This is the backend that rustc uses to produce wasi compatible wasm components. If you're using `rustup` to manage your toolchain, Cargo will automatically install the target when you're building.
3. `wasm-tools`: this is the swiss army knife for working with wasm artifacts, courtesy of the [Bytecode Alliance](https://bytecodealliance.org/). Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/).

## Typegraph

The `WasmRuntime` currently comes in two flavours that are both based on the wasm component spec. This guide focues on the `wire` flavour, where your component is expected to implement a standard WIT interface that's designed around a simple Json based RPC wire format. Thankfully, all of that boilerplate is easy to automate away and that's exactly what we'll do using [metagen](/docs/reference/metagen) to generate the binding code.

Before anything though, we need to author the typegraph:

<TGExample
  python={require("!!code-loader!../../../../../examples/typegraphs/metagen-rs.py")}
  typescript={require("!!code-loader!../../../../../examples/typegraphs/metagen-rs.ts")}
  disablePlayground
/>

Note that the `WasmRuntime` constructor mentions a non-existent wasm file on disk. This won't be a problem for the metagen generators but we'll need to produce the artifact before we deploy the typegraph. We'll see what buliding the artifact entails in just a minute.

## Metagen

We can now tackle the boilerplate. Metagen bundles the [`fdk_rust`](/docs/reference/metagen#fdk_rust) generator which can generate all the glue code along with Rust types that correspond to our typegraph types. Let's configure a metagen target in our configuration file to get just that done.

```yaml
metagen:
  targets:
    metagen_rs:
      # this is the generator we're interested in
      - generator: fdk_rust
        # the location where to put the generated files
        path: ./metagen/rs/
        # the path to our typegraph
        typegraph_path: ./metagen-rs.ts
```

The configuration file is read by the [meta CLI](/docs/reference/meta-cli) which also bundles the metagen suite. This means we can invoke the target from the command line like so:

```bash
meta gen metagen_rs
```

This should give us the following files:

```shell
❯ lsd --tree metagen/rs/
 rs
├──  Cargo.toml
├──  lib.rs
└──  fdk.rs
```

By default, the `fdk_rust` generator outputs all the necessary files required to build our wasm file. This includes the `Cargo.toml` manifest for our Rust crate.

<CodeBlock language="toml">
  {
    require("!!code-loader!../../../../../examples/typegraphs/metagen/rs/Cargo.toml")
      .content
  }
</CodeBlock>

`fdk_rust` will not overwrite a `Cargo.toml` file discovered at generation path so you can add other dependencies if need be.

The `fdk.rs` file contains all the glue code including the typegraph types.

<details>
  <summary>
    Code generation sample. It's collapsed here as it's for the most part an
    uninteresting implementation detail.
  </summary>
  <CodeBlock language="rust">
    {
      require("!!code-loader!../../../../../examples/typegraphs/metagen/rs/fdk.rs")
        .content
    }
  </CodeBlock>
</details>

When working on the typegraph, we can run metagen again to regenerate this file and get the latest types.

The generator also includes a sample `lib.rs` entrypoint file for our crate. We'll modify it now to implement our custom function.

<CodeBlock language="rust">
  {
    require("!!code-loader!../../../../../examples/typegraphs/metagen/rs/lib.rs")
      .content
  }
</CodeBlock>

## Building

We'll now use the rust toolchain and wasm-tools to build the wasm component. This requires multiple commands. It's presented below as a shell script that you can modify from.

```bash
# flags to make script execution visible
set -eux

# regenerate code before building
meta gen metagen_rs

# variablize common names
TARGET=wasm32-wasi
CRATE_NAME=metagen_rs_fdk

# build in release mode for smallest sizes
cargo build -p $CRATE_NAME --target $TARGET --release
# use wasm-tools to change wasm file into wasm component
wasm-tools component new \
  # rust builds the wasm file under the name of the crate
  ./target/$TARGET/debug/$CRATE_NAME.wasm \
  -o ./target/rust-component.wasm \

# copy the component to a location that we specified
# in our typegraph
cp ./target/rust-component.wasm ./rust.wasm
```

Put the shell script into a file like `build.sh` and execute it with a posix compatible shell like `bash`. You should now have all the files to deploy your typegraph.

<TGExample
  typegraph="metagen-rs"
  typescript={require("!!code-loader!../../../../../examples/typegraphs/metagen-rs.ts")}
  python={require("!!code-loader!../../../../../examples/typegraphs/metagen-rs.py")}
  query={require("./metagen.graphql")}
/>
