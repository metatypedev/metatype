**Are all of Metatype's components open source?**

Strictly speaking, only the ones licensed under the MPL-2.0 license are. The
rest is not an open source software as define by the
[Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/osd). However, they belong to
the [Fair-code](https://faircode.io) family and promotes similar values (free to
use, distribution-friendly, open source code, easily extensible), yet allowing
to build a sustainable ecosystem for all around it.

We are strong believer in open source mindset and are committed to contribute
back as much as possible of the internals to the community as Metatype grows.

**Conditions or obligations of the license is not clear enough for me or my
company, what can I do?**

Fair-code licenses may have some fuzzy license boundaries, and we definitely do
not want this to stop your usage. In case there is any doubt, please reach out
to our support for clarification. We will be pleased to help you build the
future with Metatype as a core element.
