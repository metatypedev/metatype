> Metatype is close to reach a stable release state, yet missing some more
> components to be complete. The ecosystem is already successfully used in
> production by some companies.
>
> Enough features are available for you to build and compose API blocks even
> though the experience may not be as smooth as desired. As such, it does _not_
> follow semantic versioning yet, and all changes will be explicitly outlined in
> the [changelog](https://github.com/metatypedev/metatype/releases)
> (watch/subscribe to this repository to be notified).
