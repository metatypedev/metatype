Metatype is an **HTTP/GraphQL query engine** that enables developers to deploy
virtual graphs connecting all the components of their stack. They can easily
**compose databases, APIs and business logic** in a type safe manner. The
serverless engine compiles, optimizes, runs and caches queries on the fly.
Authentication, authorization and security also come for free.

> Metatype is close to reach a stable release state, yet it misses some more
> components to be complete. As such, it does **not** follow semantic versioning
> yet, and all changes will be explicitly outlined in the
> [changelog](https://github.com/metatypedev/metatype/releases) (watch/subscribe
> to this repository to be notified).
