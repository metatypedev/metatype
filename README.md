> Metatype is on its first release track and does not have all components
> complete yet. However it is already successfully used in production in
> open-source and commercial solutions. Enough features are available for you to
> build a complete API composition even though the experience may not be as
> smooth as desired. All interfaces changes will be outlined in the
> [changelog](https://github.com/metatypedev/metatype/releases) (watch/subscribe
> to this repository to be notified).
