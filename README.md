Metatype is an **HTTP/GraphQL query engine** that enables developers to deploy
virtual graphs connecting all the components of their stack. They can easily
**compose databases, APIs and business logic** in a type safe manner. The
serverless engine compiles, optimizes, runs and caches queries on the fly.
Authentication, authorization and security also come for free.

> Metatype is close to reach a stable release state, yet it misses some more
