> Metatype is on its first release track and does not have all components
> complete & stabilized yet. However it is already successfully used in
> production in open-source and commercial solutions. Enough features are
> available for you to build a complete API composition even though the
> experience may not be as smooth as desired. All interfaces changes will be
> outlined in the [changelog](https://github.com/metatypedev/metatype/releases)
> (watch/subscribe to this repository to be notified).
