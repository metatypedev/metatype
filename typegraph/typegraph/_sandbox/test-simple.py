            Motivation: since card {a, b} > 0, we can throw "a, b are reserved"

            * ChildOnly = Child - Parent = BBB
            * ParentOnly = AAAXYBBB - BBB = AAAXY
            Then Child = ??? = YBBB
            Pb: Using Child and Parent, find f, f(Child, Parent) = YBBB

            * if we can exploit an info that allow us to tell X apart from Y then
            we can filter X then proceed to compute:
            (Child - X) - (Parent - X) = (AAAXYBBB - X) - (AAAX - X) = YBBB
            => ParentOnly U YBBB = AAAXY U YBBB = AAAXYBBB = Child (=all attr)
            Which proves that X is the set of the reserved names used by the user
