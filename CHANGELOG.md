Remove restrictions for union/either types (<a href="https://github.com/metatypedev/metatype/pull/761">#761</a>)

Having a good title and description is important for the users to get

-->

<!-- 1. Explain WHAT the change is about -->

In the previous versions, we restricted the variant types allowed in
union/either to be all in the same category (after flattening
multi-level unions):
- *Category 1* - **GraphQL leaf types**: scalar type, or array of scalar
type, which require no selection set on GraphQL.
- *Category 2* - **GraphQL non-leaf types**: object type or array of
object type, which require a selection set on GraphQL (aka selectable
types in the codebase).

Those restrictions can be lifted, and the selection field of an
union-type field will have inline fragments with type conditions for
each *Category 2* variant. No type condition is required for *Category
1* types, the selection sets are not relevant.

The case that is not handled by this PR is when one of the variants is
an array of union type.

  - BREAKING: back to deno + jsr exploration (<a href="https://github.com/metatypedev/metatype/pull/760">#760</a>)
</summary>

Try reverting back to deno runtime for the typescript sdk in hope of
making the dx easier.
Hosting a custom node/npm project adds more layer of indirection which
may result in cryptic issues sometimes.

This should also facilitate publishing on jsr although additional work
are still required on the `jco` codegen side.

Update the implementation of `t.engine()`

<!-- 1. Explain below WHAT the change is -->

The change comes with removing the different spin-offs of `t.engine`
which arose from the previous impl of t.engine incompatibility with
artifact upload protocol. The change will make `t.engine` deploy the
artifacts in Artifact Resolution mode by running a shell command to
deploy the typegraph.

- [x] add tg_deploy caller script which imports typegraphs dynamically
and deploys them.
- [x] make changes to make `t.engine` run in artifact resolution mode 
- [x] update existing tests to adhere to the current change
- [x] pass unique different `tempDir`s to all the typegate instances
created during test.
- [x] add support for authoring multiple typegraphs in a single file in
`meta-test` and add multi typegraph tests.

#### Migration notes

python SDK test typegraphs' function names should be the same with the
filename of the typegraph file, for dynamic import compatibility
reasons.

#### Motivation and context

Remove duplicate logic, thinking of cli as a convenience on top of the
SDK.

#### Migration notes

When meta cli is used, Migration files are unpacked/resolved relative to
the typegraph's path, not the process's `workdir`.

(gate) Wasmtime support (<a href="https://github.com/metatypedev/metatype/pull/669">#669</a>)
  - BREAKING: wasmtime support (<a href="https://github.com/metatypedev/metatype/pull/669">#669</a>)
</summary>

#### Motivation and context

Enable support for
[wit](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md)
and facilitate readiness for the upcoming specs.

#### Migration notes
`#[wasmedge_bindgen]` are replaced by wit bindings.

In the old version we were restricted to`#[wasmedge_bindgen]`, which was
only available in Rust and unique to WasmEdge.
```rust
#[wasmedge_bindgen]
fn add(a: u32, b: u32) -> u32 {
   a + b
}
```

In the new implementation, wasm modules written in any language that
uses the `wit` interface are now natively supported within `typegate`.
```wit
// wit/example.wit
package example:host;
world host {
  export add: func(a: u32, b: u32) -> u32;
}
```
An implementation (eg. in Rust) may look like this..
```rust
// src/lib.rs
wit_bindgen::generate!({ world: "host" });
struct MyLib;
impl Guest for MyLib {
    fn add(a: u32, b: u32) -> u32 {
        a + b
    }
}
export!(MyLib);

#### Motivation and context

The mdk codegen and typegraph mutually depends on each other (typegraph
needs a concrete mdk.wasm for hashing, and for the mdk.wasm to be built,
it needs type generation based on the typegraph)
Add a flag to enable processing a partial typegraph when using `meta
gen` (partial == no artifact resolution).

`get_file_hash` has been moved to core sdk (under the name `hash_file`)

#### Motivation and context

Reduce Redis data.

#### Migration notes

Environment variables:
- `REDIS_URL` has been removed
- For multiple instance support, the following variables are required:
`SYNC_REDIS_URL`, `SYNC_S3_HOST`, `SYNC_S3_REGION`, `SYNC_S3_BUCKET`,
`SYNC_S3_ACCESS_KEY`, `SYNC_S3_SECRET_KEY`; and the following variables
are optional: `SYNC_REDIS_PASSWORD`, `SYNC_S3_PATH_STYLE`. Otherwise,
none of them can be set.

  - BREAKING: Remove secret definitions through env vars (<a href="https://github.com/metatypedev/metatype/pull/666">#666</a>)
</summary>

Remove the ability to define secrets  in the env vars of the typegate.

Secrets can now only be defined in the metatype config file and the
`--secret` CLI option.

#### Motivation and context

-
[MET-370](https://linear.app/metatypedev/issue/MET-370/easier-way-to-pass-secrets-in-metatypeyaml-config-file)
- Security
- Better DX

#### Migration notes

1. **Metatype config file**: On the node configuration, secrets are
defined at `secrets.<tg_name>.key`:

```yaml
# before
typegates:
  dev:
    env:
      TG_CONSOLE_POSTGRES_CONN: postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/db?schema=console
      TG_CONSOLE_BASIC_ADMIN: password

      console:
        POSTGRES_CONN: postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/db?schema=console
        BASIC_ADMIN: password    
```

2. **Secret override option on meta/cli**

```sh
# before
meta deploy -f my-tg.py --secret TG_CONSOLE_POSTGRES_CONN=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/db?schema=console

# after
