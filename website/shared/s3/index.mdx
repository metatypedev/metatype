The [S3Runtime](/docs/reference/runtimes/s3) can be used to interact with object storage APIs that are S3 compatible. Object storages like S3 are commonly used to cover app needs around large blob data like uploading and serving images. Most object storage services provide S3 compatible APIs including the open-source [MinIO](https://min.io/) engine which you can run locally for development.

For the following example, you'll need to setup your S3 compatible store first. The following snippet can get you started using minio on docker compose:

```yaml
services:
  minio:
    image: bitnami/minio:2022
    platform: linux/amd64
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
      - "9001:9001"
    environment:
      MINIO_REGION_NAME: local
      MINIO_ROOT_USER: minio
      MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
      MINIO_DEFAULT_BUCKETS: "bucket:none"
```

We then provide the following secrets to our typegraph through `metatype.yml`.

```yml
typegates:
  dev:
    secrets:
      # ..
      # replace "files-upload" by the name of your typegraph
      files-upload:
        S3_HOST: http://localhost:9000
        S3_REGION: local
        S3_ACCESS_KEY: minio
        S3_SECRET_KEY: password
        S3_PATH_STYLE: true
```

Our typegraph will then look something like:

<TGExample
  typegraph="files-upload"
  typescript={require("!!code-loader!../../../examples/typegraphs/files-upload.ts")}
  python={require("!!code-loader!../../../examples/typegraphs/files-upload.py")}
  query={require("./files.graphql")}
/>

Peruse the [reference](/docs/reference/runtimes/s3) on the `S3Runtime` for more information.
