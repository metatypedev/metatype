You can download the binary executable from
[releases page](https://github.com/metatypedev/metatype/releases/) on GitHub, make it
executable and add it to your `$PATH` or use
[eget](https://github.com/zyedidia/eget) to automate those steps.

```bash
$ # make sure $HOME/.local/bin/ is in $PATH or choose another directory
$ eget metatypedev/metatype --to $HOME/.local/bin

$ meta --help
$ meta upgrade # to upgrade to the latest version
```
