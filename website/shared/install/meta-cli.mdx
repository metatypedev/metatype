Metatype is only supported on macOS and Linux. Windows users should use [Linux on Windows with WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install).

:::

You can download the binary from the
[releases page](https://github.com/metatypedev/metatype/releases/), make it
executable and add it to your `PATH` or use the automated method below.

- First, you start by installing `Meta CLI`. The installer may ask for your password.
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metatypedev/metatype/main/installer.sh | bash
    ```
    TODO: Add result image/log

- Next, you need to install [libwasmedge](https://wasmedge.org/docs/contribute/source/build_from_src/#what-will-be-built), which is a dependency to run `Meta CLI` on your machine.
    ```bash
    export WASMEDGE_VERSION=0.13.8
    curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- -v $WASMEDGE_VERSION
    ```

- After successfully installing `libwasmedge`, you need to set it as a path variable to access it from terminal. You can use the following command to set the path variable, but it's advisable to add it to your shell rc permanently. 
    ```bash
    # for macOS,
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/.wasmedge/lib
    ```

    ```bash
    # for linux,
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/.wasmedge/lib 
    ```

- A `thin` version of the cli that doesn't rely on libwasmedge is also provided.
This version of the cli doesn't offer the `typegate` command that lets you spin up a typegate for development purposes.
To install it, you can pass `META_THIN=1` environment variable to the installer script or download it from the github releases.
    ```bash
    export META_THIN=1
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metatypedev/metatype/main/installer.sh | bash
    ```

- For later use, you can run the following command to upgrade `Meta CLI` to a newer version. If your Meta CLI is up to date, you will get an `Already up to date!` response.
    ```bash
    meta upgrade
    ```

That's it! You are done installing `Meta CLI`.
