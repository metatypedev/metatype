Metatype is only supported on macOS and Linux. Windows users should use [Linux on Windows with WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install).

:::

You can download the binary from the
[releases page](https://github.com/metatypedev/metatype/releases/), make it
executable and add it to your `PATH` or use the automated method below.

```bash
# the installer may ask for your password
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metatypedev/metatype/main/installer.sh | bash

# (optional, read below) install libwasmedge and... 
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- -v $WASMEDGE_VERSION
# (linux) ...add it to dynamic libraries path
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/.wasmedge/lib 
# (macos) ...add it to dynamic libraries path 
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/.wasmedge/lib
# consider permanently adding this to your shell rc

# (for later) upgrade to a newer version
meta upgrade
```

A `thin` version of the cli that doesn't rely on libwasmedge is also provided.
This version of the cli doesn't offer the `typegate` command that lets you spin up a typegate for development purposes.
To install it, you can pass `META_THIN=1` environment variable to the installer script or download it from the github relases.
