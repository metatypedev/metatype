The _Meta CLI_ comes with an embedded typegate packaged inside it. A [typegate](/docs/reference/typegate) instance is where you deploy your [typegraphs](/docs/reference/typegraph) where any logic written in them is exposed via an HTTP or GraphQL endpoints. You can run an embedded typegate node from the terminal, but you first need to set a couple of environment variables which are needed to instantiate the typegate node.

Set the `tg_admin_password` and `tg_secret` environment variables. You can use the following command to configure a sample value for the variables and test the embedded typegate.

```shell
export tg_secret=a4lNi0PbEItlFZbus1oeH/+wyIxi9uH6TpL8AIqIaMBNvp7SESmuUBbfUwC0prxhGhZqHw8vMDYZAGMhSZ4fLw== tg_admin_password=password
```

If you have not installed _Meta CLI_ or you have downloaded the _thin_ version, you can check [this](/docs/reference/meta-cli#Installation) installation guide of the _CLI_.

Everything is setup to run the embedded typegate. Just run the following command below.

```shell
meta typegate
```

The typegate instance runs on port `7890` by default. You can check if the typegate node is running by accessing [http://localhost:7890](http://localhost:7890) in your browser.
