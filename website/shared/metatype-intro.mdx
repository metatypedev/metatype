Metatype is an open platform for developers to **declaratively build APIs**. It offers a new approach to creating backends, where the developers focus on data modelling and delegate the implementation to the platform.

The intent is to address the following challenges:

- developers are often a bottleneck, and may spend less than 50% of their time on tasks that matter
- most of the developments needs are similar, yet most of the systems are not interoperable
- infrastructure management takes time and slows down the deployment velocity

The platform is composed of the following components:

- [**Typegraph**](/docs/reference/typegraph): a multi-language SDK to manage typegraphs - virtual graphs of types - and compose them
- [**Typegate**](/docs/reference/typegate): a serverless REST/GraphQL gateway to execute queries over typegraphs
- [**Meta CLI**](/docs/reference/meta-cli): a command-line tool to offer a great developer experience and fast deployment
