Metatype is a **composition ecosystem** for developers. It allows to build autonomous, discoverable, and modular API blocks with automatic orchestration. These API blocks are technology-agnostic and enable developers to iterate fast, yet remaining agile and focusing on domain design model as stacks grow.

The ecosystem consists of the following parts:

- [**Typegraph**](/docs/concepts/typegraph): a package to describe typegraphs - virtual graphs of types - and their compositions
- [**Typegate**](/docs/concepts/typegate): a HTTP/GraphQL gateway bundled with a scalable and fast query engine
- [**Meta CLI**](/docs/concepts/meta-cli): a command-line tool to provide great developer experience and serverless deployments
