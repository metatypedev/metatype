Metatype is a **low-code composition platform** for developers. It allows to build autonomous, discoverable, and modular APIs with automatic orchestration. These APIs are technology-agnostic and enable developers to iterate fast, yet remaining agile and focusing on data modelling as the stack grow.

The platform consists of the following components:

- [**Typegraph**](/docs/concepts/typegraph): a package to describe typegraphs - virtual graphs of types - and their compositions
- [**Typegate**](/docs/concepts/typegate): a distributed HTTP/GraphQL query engine acting as a scalable gateway
- [**Meta CLI**](/docs/concepts/meta-cli): a command-line tool to provide great developer experience and serverless deployment
