Metatype is a **composition ecosystem** for developers. It allows to build autonomous, discoverable, and modular API blocks with automatic orchestration. These API blocks are technology agnostic and enable developers to iterate fast, yet remaining agile and focusing on domain design model as stacks grow.

The ecosystem consists of the following parts:

- [**Typegraph**](/docs/concepts/typegraph): a package to describe typegraphs - virtual graphs of types - and their compositions
- [**Typegate**](/docs/concepts/typegate): a HTTP/GraphQL gateway bundled with a scalable and fast query engine
- [**Meta CLI**](/docs/concepts/meta-cli): a command-line tool to provide great developer experience and serverless deployments
