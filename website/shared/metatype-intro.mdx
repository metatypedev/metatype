Metatype is an open source platform for developers to **declaratively build APIs**. It offers a unique approach to building backends, where the focus is all on data modelling and the platform takes care of the rest.

The intent is to find a convenient computing model that tackles the following challenges:

- most developers still spend too much time on tasks with low-value (crud, data validation, compliance, etc.)
- when growing a product, it is hard to keep up with business needs and remain innovative with technology
- managing server and infrastructure shall never be a concern for developers nor slow them down

In that respect, Metatype can be seen as an alternative to Hasura, Strapi, Firebase, or even web frameworks like Django or NestJS. You can see how Metatype differs reading the [conceptual overview](/docs/concepts/overview) or the [comparison summary](/docs/concepts/comparisons).

The platform consists of the following components:

- [**Typegraph**](/docs/concepts/typegraph): a package to describe typegraphs - virtual graphs of types - and compose them
- [**Typegate**](/docs/concepts/typegate): a distributed REST/GraphQL query engine to execute queries over typegraphs
- [**Meta CLI**](/docs/concepts/meta-cli): a command-line tool to provide great developer experience and serverless deployment

A vast range of [runtimes](/docs/reference/runtimes) is implemented by the platform and provides out of the box support for storing data in databases/S3, connecting to third-party/internal APIs and running business logic in Deno/Python/WebAssembly.
