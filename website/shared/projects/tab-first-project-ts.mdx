There are two variations to write your app using Typescript. You can either use `node` or `deno` as the TypeScript runtime. For now, you will be using `node`. To bootstrap a node `Metatype` project, you can run the following commands.

```bash
# create startup files
meta new --template node

# install dependencies
npm install
```

This will create the necessary files for development, some of which are:

- `.graphqlrc.yaml`: configuration file to define settings and options related to GraphQL.
- `compose.yml`: is where the typegate node and similar services are setup.
- `metatype.yaml`: is where you configure different variables such as authentication, secrets... used by the backend.

The command also creates a directory called `api` where you will be building much of your applications's business logic. Inside the `api` directory, you will find a single file called `example.ts` which defines a simple [Typegraph](/docs/reference/typegraph).

<CodeBlock language="typescript">
  {
    require("!!code-loader!../../../examples/templates/node/api/example.ts")
      .content
  }
</CodeBlock>

Let's break down the above code snippet. The `typegraph` function is your building block and it encompasses most of the app logic inside. It takes a name and a callback function as an argument. All the magic is done inside the callback function.

Metatype uses Policy Based [Access Control](/docs/reference/policies) for accessing resources in your backend and here you have defined a public access.

```typescript
const pub = Policy.public();
```

There are two runtimes defined namely [PythonRuntime](/docs/reference/runtimes/python) and [DenoRuntime](/docs/reference/runtimes/deno). You will be using these two runtimes to perform different data operations along with the other [runtimes](/docs/reference/runtimes) Metatype provides.

```typescript
const deno = new DenoRuntime();
const python = new PythonRuntime();
```

Now that you have runtimes to process data and you have specified your access control, you need to define endpoints to communicate with your backend. This is where you use the `g.expose` method to enumerate the endpoints you want in your application. From the starter file, you can see that you have defined two endpoints, `add` and `multiply`.

```typescript
g.expose({
  add: python
    .fromLambda(t.struct({ first: t.float(), second: t.float() }), t.float(), {
      code: "lambda x: x['first'] + x['second']",
    })
    .withPolicy(pub),
  multiply: deno
    .func(t.struct({ first: t.float(), second: t.float() }), t.float(), {
      code: "({first, second}) => first * second",
    })
    .withPolicy(pub),
});
```

Let's dive into what the `add` endpoint is doing. The `add` endpoint defines a `custom function` which does data processing using the `PythonRuntime`. When you are defining the custom function, you pass the input type, output type and then a [function](/docs/concepts/mental-model#functions).

That's it! You have created your first `Metatype` app. It's as easy as this. Before you go ahead and test your app, let's add two more endpoints which peform basic `Create` and `Read` database operation.

In order to exercise database capabilities, you need to build a table schema or a model. The typegraph SDK provides rich [Types](/docs/reference/types) which you can use to create any database table that fits to your usecase. Let's create a simple Message table which has fields `id`, `title` and `body`. This is what it will look like in code.

```typescript
const message = t.struct(
  {
    id: t.integer({}, { asId: true, config: { auto: true } }), // configuring your primary key
    title: t.string(),
    body: t.string(),
  },
  { name: "message" } // the name of your type
);
```

Great! Now you need a runtime which processes database requests. You will be using another runtime that comes out of the box with `Metatype`. i.e the [PrismaRuntime](/docs/reference/runtimes/prisma). Let's go ahead and introduce the `PrismaRuntime` to your app. You can add the following code below the two runtimes that were predefined.

```typescript
...
const python = new PythonRuntime();
const db = new PrismaRuntime("database", "POSTGRES_CONN");
```

Last, you need to expose a `Create` and `Read` endpoints to your database table. Let's add these two lines to `g.expose`.

```typescript
...
g.expose({
    ...,
    // add following to your typegraph
    create_message: db.create(message).withPolicy(pub),
    list_messages: db.findMany(message).withPolicy(pub),
});
```

With these three simple steps, you were able to build a basic backend with database capabilities. Finally, this is what your typegraph looks like in `example.ts`.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">
  {
    require("!!code-loader!../../../examples/typegraphs/quick-start-project.ts")
      .content
  }
</CodeBlock>

You are almost there to test your first `Metatype` application. You now need to spin a [Tyepgate](/docs/reference/typegate) and deploy your typegraph to the instance. You can leverage the embedded typegate that comes with the _Meta_CLI_. To run the embedded typegate, you can follow this [reference](/docs/reference/meta-cli/embedded-typegate).

Once you started your typegate instance using one of the available choice, if you open [localhost:7890](http://localhost:7890) in your browser, you will get a webpage similar to this one.

<img src="/images/tutorial/running-typegate.png" alt="running typegate" />{" "}

To deploy your typegraph to the typegate engine, there are two approaces you can follow. You can either use `self-deploy` which comes with the typegraph SDK or the [Meta CLI](/docs/reference/meta-cli). For now, you will be deploying your typegraph using the `Meta CLI`. Execute the command below on your terminal to deploy the typegraph.

```bash
meta deploy -f api/example.ts --allow-dirty --create-migration --target dev --gate http://localhost:7890
```

Upon successful deployment of the typegraph, you should recieve a response similar like this.

```console
(example-py3.11) user@pc first-project % meta deploy -f api/example.py --allow-dirty --create-migration --target dev --gate http://localhost:7890
[INFO] Loading module "/Users/user/Documents/metatype-playground/projects/first-project/api/example.ts"
[INFO] Loaded 1 typegraph from "/Users/user/Documents/metatype-playground/projects/first-project/api/example.ts": example
[INFO] All modules have been loaded. Stopping the loader.
[INFO] Pushing typegraph example (from '/Users/user/Documents/metatype-playground/projects/first-project/api/example.ts')
[INFO] âœ“ Successfully pushed typegraph example.
```

You have deployed your first typegraph. It's time to run and test your backend which is running on the typegate instance. Click [here](http://localhost:7890/example) to open a `GraphiQL` interface and interact with your backend through `graphql` queries from your browser. You should get a page similar to the one below.

<img src="/images/tutorial/tg-on-typegate.png" alt="typegraph on typegate" />

Now you can play with your app through the interface. You can try this `graphql` query as a start.

Create a message using the following mutation.

```graphql
mutation {
  create_message(
    data: {
      title: "First typegraph"
      body: "Congrats on your first typegraph."
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

Then, fetch the created message using the query below.

```graphql
query {
  list_messages
}
```

You should get a response from the typegate similar to then one below.

<img src="/images/tutorial/query-result.png" alt="query result" />

You can also try out what you have built so far here on this playground.

<TGExample
  typegraph="quick-start-project"
  typescript={require("!!code-loader!../../../examples/typegraphs/quick-start-project.ts")}
  query={require("./first-project.graphql")}
/>
