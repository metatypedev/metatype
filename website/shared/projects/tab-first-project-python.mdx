To bootstrap a python `Metatype` project, run the following commands on your terminal.

```bash
# create startup files
meta new --template python

# install dependencies
poetry install

# create and activate virtual environment
poetry shell
```

This will create the necessary files for development, some of which are:

- `.graphqlrc.yaml`: configuration file to define settings and options related to GraphQL.
- `compose.yml`: is where the typegate node and similar services are setup.
- `metatype.yaml`: is where you configure different variables such as authentication, secrets... used by the backend.

The command also creates a directory called `api` where you will be building much of your applications's business logic. Inside the `api` directory, you will find a single file called `example.py` which defines a simple [Typegraph](/docs/reference/typegraph).

<CodeBlock language="python">
  {
    require("!!code-loader!../../../examples/templates/python/api/example.py")
      .content
  }
</CodeBlock>

Let's break down the above code snippet. The `example` function is where most of the logic lives. You need to decorate the function with `@typegraph()` from the typegraph SDK. Inside the function, you have different components of your application.

Metatype uses Policy Based [Access Control](/docs/reference/policies) for accessing resources in your backend and here you have defined a public access.

```python3
public = Policy.public()
```

There is a runtime defined namely [PythonRuntime](/docs/reference/runtimes/python). You will be using the runtime to perform different data operations along with the other [runtimes](/docs/reference/runtimes) Metatype provides.

```python3
python = PythonRuntime()
```

Now that you have runtimes to process data and you have specified access control, you need to define endpoints to communicate with your backend. This is where you use the `g.expose` method to enumerate the endpoints you want in your application. From the starter file, you can see that you have defined an endpoint `hello`.

```python3
# custom functions
hello = python.from_lambda(
  t.struct({"world": t.string()}),
  t.string(),
  lambda x: f"Hello {x['world']}!",
)

g.expose(public, hello=hello)
```

The `hello` endpoint is mapped with a `custom function` which accepts a `string` and returns **hello** concatinated with the `string`. The processing of data is done using the `PythonRuntime`. When you are defining the custom function, you pass the input type, output type and then a [function](/docs/concepts/mental-model#functions).

That's it! You have created your first `Metatype` app. It's as easy as this. Before you go ahead and test your app, let's add two more endpoints which peform basic `Create` and `Read` database operation.

In order to exercise database capabilities, you need to build a table schema or a model. The typegraph SDK provides rich [Types](/docs/reference/types) which you can use to create any database table that fits to your usecase. Let's create a simple Message table which has fields `id`, `title` and `body`. This is what it will look like in code.

```python3
message = t.struct(
  {
    id"": t.integer(as_id=True, config=["auto"]),
    "title": t.string(),
    "body": t.string(),
  },
  name="message",
)
```

Great! Now you need a runtime which processes database requests. You will be using another runtime that comes out of the box with `Metatype`. i.e the [PrismaRuntime](/docs/reference/runtimes/prisma). Let's go ahead and introduce the `PrismaRuntime` to your app. You can add the following code below the `PythonRuntime` that was predefined.

```python3
...
python = PythonRuntime()
db = PrismaRuntime("database", "POSTGRES_CONN")
```

Last, you need to expose a `Create` and `Read` endpoints to your database table. Let's add these two lines to `g.expose`.

```python3
...
g.expose(
  public,
  hello=hello,
  create_message=db.create(message),
  list_messages=db.find_many(message),
)
```

With these simple steps, you were able to build a basic backend with database capabilities. Finally, this is what your typegraph looks like in `example.py`.

<CodeBlock language="python">
  {
    require("!!code-loader!../../../examples/typegraphs/quick-start-project.py")
      .content
  }
</CodeBlock>

You are almost there to test your first `Metatype` application. You now need to spin a [Tyepgate](/docs/reference/typegate) and deploy your typegraph to the instance. You can leverage the embedded typegate that comes with the _Meta CLI_. To run the [embedded typegate](/docs/reference/meta-cli/embedded-typegate), execute the following command from your terminal.

```shell
meta dev
```

Once you started your typegate instance using one of the available choice, if you open [localhost:7890](http://localhost:7890) in your browser, you will get a webpage similar to this one.

To deploy your typegraph to the typegate engine, there are two approaces you can follow. You can either use [self-deploy](/docs/guides/programmatic-deployment) which comes with the typegraph SDK or the [Meta CLI](/docs/reference/meta-cli). For now, you will be deploying your typegraph using the `Meta CLI`. Execute the command below on your terminal to deploy the typegraph.

```bash
meta deploy -f api/example.py --allow-dirty --create-migration --target dev --gate http://localhost:7890
```

Upon successful deployment of the typegraph, you should recieve a response similar like this.

```console
(example-py3.11) user@pc first-project % meta deploy -f api/example.py --allow-dirty --create-migration --target dev --gate http://localhost:7890
[INFO] Loading module "/Users/user/Documents/metatype-playground/projects/first-project/api/example.py"
[INFO] Loaded 1 typegraph from "/Users/user/Documents/metatype-playground/projects/first-project/api/example.py": example
[INFO] All modules have been loaded. Stopping the loader.
[INFO] Pushing typegraph example (from '/Users/user/Documents/metatype-playground/projects/first-project/api/example.py')
[INFO] âœ“ Successfully pushed typegraph example.
```

You have deployed your first typegraph. It's time to run and test your backend which is running on your typegate instance. Click [here](http://localhost:7890/example) to open a `GraphiQL` interface and interact with your backend through `graphql` queries from your browser. You should get a page similar to the one below.

<img src="/images/tutorial/tg-on-typegate.png" alt="typegraph on typegate" />

Now you can play with your app through the interface. You can try this `graphql` query as a start.

Create a message using the following mutation.

```graphql
mutation {
  create_message(
    data: {
      title: "First typegraph"
      body: "Congrats on your first typegraph."
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

Then, fetch the created message using the query below.

```graphql
query {
  list_messages
}
```

You should get a response from the typegate similar to then one below.

<img src="/images/tutorial/query-result.png" alt="query result" />

You can also try out what you have built so far here on this playground.

<TGExample
  typegraph="quick-start-project"
  python={require("!!code-loader!../../../examples/typegraphs/quick-start-project.py")}
  query={require("./first-project.graphql")}
/>
