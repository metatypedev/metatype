Now you are ready to develop for your first project! You can use [meta doctor](#4-verify-your-installation) to check if neccessary components are installed. 
Let's start by creating a working directory for the project. Open your terminal and run the following commands. 
```bash
mkdir metatype-project
cd metatype-project
```

Now that you have your workspace and development environment setup, let's start building a simple `CRUD` application.

The SDK used for developing `Metatype` applications is the [Typegraph](/docs/reference/typegraph). Currently, it's available through Typescript and Python.

<SDKTabs>
    <TabItem value="typescript">
        <TypeScriptTab />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="python">
      <PythonTab />
    </TabItem>
    
</SDKTabs>
