import SDKTabs from "@site/src/components/SDKTabs";

import PythonTab from "./tab-first-project-python.mdx";
import TypeScriptTab from "./tab-first-project-ts.mdx";

Now you are ready to develop for your first app! You can use [meta doctor](#4-verify-your-installation) to check if neccessary components are installed. Let's start by creating a working directory for the project. Open your terminal and run the following commands.

```bash
mkdir first-project
cd first-project
```

Now that you have your workspace and development environment setup, let's start building a simple `CRUD` application.

The SDK used for developing `Metatype` applications is the [Typegraph](/docs/reference/typegraph). Currently, it's available through Typescript and Python.

  <TabItem value="typescript">
