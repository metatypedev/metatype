Metatype is a **composition ecosystem** for developers. It allows to build autonomous, discoverable, and modular API blocks that can be easily orchestrated.
These building blocks are technology agnostic and enable developers to iterate fast, yet remaining agile and focusing on domain design model as the stack grow.

The ecosystem consists of the following parts:

- [**Typegraph**](/docs/concepts/typegraph): a package to describe typegraphs - virtual graphs of types - and their compositions
- [**Typegate**](/docs/concepts/typegate): a scalable and fast query engine with serverless deployment capabilities
- [**Meta CLI**](/docs/concepts/meta-cli): a command-line tool to smooth the developer experience
