Metatype is a **composition ecosystem** for developers. It allows to build autonomous, discoverable, and modular API blocks orchestration.
These building blocks enable developers to iterate faster, remain agile as the stack grow and focus on domain design rather than implementation.

The ecosystem consists of the following parts:

- [**Typegraph**](/docs/concepts/typegraph): a package to describe typegraphs (graphs of types) and their compositions
- [**Typegate**](/docs/concepts/typegate): a scalable and fast query engine (API orchestration) with serverless deployment
- [**Meta CLI**](/docs/concepts/meta-cli): a command-line tool to smooth the developer experience
