# The Node SDK is now available

We are happy to announce that we have redesigned our SDKs to support Node and facilitate the integration of future languages. Most of the [typegraph features](/docs/reference/typegraph) have been rewritten in Rust and shaped around a core SDK targeting WebAssembly.

This enables us to provide a consistent experience across all languages and reduce the work to maintain the existing Python SDK and bring Metatype to the Node ecosystem (with Deno compatibility).

## Node

```bash
npm install @typegraph/sdk
meta new --template node .
```

## Deno

```bash
meta new --template deno .
```

```typescript
import { typegraph } from "npm:@typegraph/sdk/index.js";
```

## Give us feedback!

As always, report issues and let us know what you think on [GitHub](https://github.com/metatypedev/metatype/discussions).
