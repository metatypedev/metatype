# Metatype Basics

**This page will walk you through a real world API with data storage and authorization.**

:::note You will learn

- How to setup your development for metatype projects.
- How to run the typegate on the docker runtime.
- How to create/read/update/delete data.
- How to write custom business logic.
- How to authenticate requests.
- How to protect data with policies.

:::

## What are you building?

For this tutorial, we'll be implementing an API to power a simple feature roadmap/request hybrid as can be seen on [Productlane](https://productlane.com/roadmap).

Looking through the app we can see that the api should allow:
 - Unauthenticated users to submit new "ideas" or vote on any of those already listed.
 - Specify or vote on the importance of an "idea" from "medium" to "critical" or even submit text with more description.
 - Admins will be able to move ideas across buckets like "Backlog", "Planned", "In Progress".

        { /* TODO: consider emailing people interested in an idea when things change */}

## Setup

To setup your Metatype development environment, please follow the installation guide [here](/docs/tutorials/quick-start#1-meta-cli)

### Create a new project

Metatype projects are composed of modular bundles of types, logic and policies called typegraphs.
We author typegraphs using modern programming languages & environments. 
Python and Typescript are currently available for use.
The meta-cli allows us to create a new project based on pre-existing templates.


        <SDKTabs>
                      <TabItem value="typescript">
                            { /**/}

Run one the following commands to create a new project under a new directory titled `tg_roadmap`.

```bash
# using Node/Bun runtimes
meta new --template node tg_roadmap 
#                        ^ project name 
#                   ^  Use `meta new --help` find out more available templates. 
```

```bash
# using Deno
meta new --template deno tg_roadmap 
```

When using Typescript, the `@typegraph/sdk` package exposes all the necessary functions and types we'll need to describe our typegraph.
The templates already specify it as as a dependency so all we need to do now is run the following command to download it:

```bash
# using Deno
deno cache api/example.ts # cache dependencies

# using Bun
bun install

# using pnpm
pnpm install

# using npm
npm install

# using yarn
yarn install
```

      </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">

            { /**/}
Run the following command to create a new project under a new directory titled `tg_roadmap`.

```bash
meta new --template python tg_roadmap 
#                          ^ project name 
#                   ^  Use `meta new --help` find out more available templates. 
```

When using python, the `typegraph` package exposes all the necessary functions and types we'll need to describe our typegraph.
We'll need to run the following command to install it:

```bash
# virtual env
python3 -m venv .venv
# other activate scripts should be available for non bash shells
source .venv/bin/activate 

# using pip
pip3 install typegraph

# using poetry
# the template has included `typegraph` in the poetry manifest
poetry install 
```

      </TabItem>
                </SDKTabs>

### Launch typegate

The typegate is a program that runs and orchestrates our typegraphs.
We can run it locally for development purposes.
Typegate currently requires the Redis database to function and to make it easy to run both, we'll make use of a linux container runtime for this. 
The Docker runtime to be specific which has installation guides located [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

We'll also need the Docker Compose orchestrator which usually comes by default with the `docker` command. Use the following command to check if it is available:

```bash
docker compose version 
# Docker Compose version 2.23.0
```

...and if not, the official installation guide can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

If you have your docker runtime installed and running correctly, you will be able to launch the `compose.yml` file that's bundled in every template.
The compose file by default includes the `postgres` and `mongo` databases.
You can disable the latter by commenting it out or removing it as we'll not be needing it for this tutorial. 

To launch the services, navigate your shell to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up --detach
#                 ^ detach means it'll run in the background.
#                   Omit to get the all logs in the current terminal
```

This should download and start typegate and its dependent services. 

We can observe their log of typegate or any of the other services with the following command. It has to be run from the same project directory.

```bash
docker compose logs typegate --follow
#                   ^ Omit service name to look at the combined logs of all services
```

### Make sure it's all working

Run the following to make sure everything's up and running. 
```bash
meta doctor
```
After running the command, you should get a result similar to then one [here](/docs/tutorials/quick-start#4-verify-your-installation).

## Building our Models

We will be using the [type system](/docs/reference/types) from the typegraph SDK to describe the shape of the data that flows through our application.
In this case, we'll build our typegraph around types that represent "ideas", "votes" and "buckets".


        <SDKTabs>
                      <TabItem value="typescript">
                            { /**/}
Modify the file at `api/example.ts` to look something like the following. 

```typescript
// we'll need the following imports
import { t, typegraph } from "@typegraph/sdk.js";


typegraph("roadmap", (g) => {
  //       ^ each typegraph has a name

  const bucket = t.struct({
    // asId and other config items describe the logical properties
    // of our types beyond just the shape
    "id": t.integer({}, { asId: true }),
    "name": t.string(),
  });
  const idea = t.struct({
    // uuid is just a shorthand alias for `t.string({format: "uuid"})`
    "id": t.uuid({ asId: true }), 
    "name": t.string(),
    // another string shorthand
    "authorEmail": t.email(), 
  });
  const vote = t.struct({
    "id": t.uuid(),
    "authorEmail": t.email(),
    // `enum_` is also a shorthand over `t.string`
    "importance": t.enum_(["medium", "important", "critical"]).optional(), 
    // makes it optional
    "desc": t.string().optional(), 
  });
});
```

      </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">
            { /**/}
Modify the file at `api/example.py` to look something like the following. 

```python
# we'll need the following imports
from typegraph import typegraph, t, Graph

# the typegraph will carry the name of the defining function by default
@typegraph()
def roadmap(g: Graph):
    bucket = t.struct({
        # asId and other config items describe the logical properties
        # of our types beyond just the shape
        "id": t.integer(as_id=True),
        "name": t.string(),
    });
    idea = t.struct({
        # email is just a shorthand alias for `t.string({format: "uuid"})`
        "id": t.uuid(as_id=True), 
        "name": t.string(),
        # another string shorthand
        "authorEmail": t.email(), 
    });
    vote = t.struct({
        "id": t.uuid(),
        "authorEmail": t.email(),
        # `enum` is also a shorthand over `t.string`
        "importance": t.enum(["medium", "important", "critical"]).optional(), 
        # makes it optional
        "desc": t.string().optional(), 
    });

```
      </TabItem>
                </SDKTabs>

The types here are very simple and we haven't yet added any thing that models their relationships but they should do for our purposes.

## Exposing our application

Typegraphs expose an API to the external world using Function objects.
Functions describe the operation that transform some input type into an output type and we define them in scope of different Runtimes, where the actual logic runs. 
At this early stage, we can make use of the Random runtime which allows us to generate random test data for our types to get a feel of our API. 


        <SDKTabs>
                      <TabItem value="typescript">
                            { /**/}

```typescript
// add need the following imports
import { Policy } from "@typegraph/sdk/index.js";
import { RandomRuntime } from "@typegraph/sdk/runtimes/random.js";

typegraph("roadmap", (g) => {
  // ...
  // every exposed function requires access control policies
  // for now, just use the public policy, anyone can access it 
  const pub = Policy.public(); 
  const random = new RandomRuntime({});
  g.expose(
    {
      // generates a random object in the shape of idea
      "get_idea": random.gen(idea).withPolicy(pub),
    },
  );
});
```

      </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">
            { /*  */}
```python
# add need the following imports
from typegraph.runtimes.random import RandomRuntime
from typegraph import Policy

@typegraph()
def roadmap(g: Graph):
    # every exposed function requires access control policies
    # for now, just use the public policy, anyone can access it
    pub = Policy.public() 
    random = RandomRuntime()
    g.expose(
      # generates a random object in the shape of idea
      get_idea=random.gen(idea).with_policy(pub)
    )

```
      </TabItem>
                </SDKTabs>
At this point, we can push our typegraph to the locally running typegate node and access it.
Run the following command in your project root:

```bash
# features auto-reload on any changes to your source files
meta dev 
```

Typegate has first-class support for consuming the API through a GraphQl interface and it is enabled by default.
It also bundles the GrahpiQl API explorer and you should be able to access it at [http://localhost:7890/roadmap](http://localhost:7890/roadmap) once meta-cli has successfully pushed your typegraph.

You can go ahead and try out the following `graphql` on the interface and get a feel for it.
```graphql
query {
  get_idea {
    id,
    name,
    authorEmail
  }
}
```

Or, you can mess around on the playground below.

    <TGExample
      typegraph="first-typegraph"
      python={require("../../../../examples/typegraphs/first-typegraph.py")}
      typescript={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/first-typegraph.ts")}
      query={require("./query.graphql")}
    />

### The Prisma Runtime

Now that we have created a simple endpoint that generates random values for our `idea` model/type, let's add a CRUD support to our app.
A runtime most apps will be depend on is the [Prisma Runtime](/docs/reference/runtimes/prisma) which allows us to connect to different databases and peform database operations.

For this tutorial, we'll be making use of the `PostgreSQL` database. 
If you made use of the `compose.yml` to run typegate as outlined in this tutorial, there should be an instance of Postgres already up.
You can check if postgres container is currently running by using the `meta doctor` command.

If a typegraph needs to access a database, it first needs to be made aware of its address.
This is done through secrets.
In the root of your project directory, you'll find a file titled `metatype.yaml`.
It contains metatype specific configuration for our project such as the top level `typegates` object which we use to specify the location and credentials of the different typegate nodes we'll be using.
Each typegate entry also takes an [`secrets`](/docs/reference/meta-cli/configuration-file#named-secrets) object where we can specify secret to be passed to our typegraphs.

The keys in the `secrets` object are the names of the typegraphs and the values are objects mapping secret names to their values/sources.

The `metatype.yaml` should already have a few sample environment variables. 
Add an entry like the following to give our typegraph access to the database's address:

```yaml
typegates:
  dev:
    # ..
    secrets:
      TG_ROADMAP_POSTGRES: "postgresql://postgres:password@postgres:5432/db"
```

Meta-cli will auto-reload when it detects changes to `metatype.yaml`. This is because Meta-cli was run in `dev` mode(through the `meta dev` command).

We can add the Prisma runtime to our typegraph now.


        <SDKTabs>
                      <TabItem value="typescript">
                            { /**/}

```typescript
// new imports
import { PrismaRuntime } from "@typegraph/sdk/providers/prisma.js";

typegraph("roadmap", (g) => {
  // ...
  
  // the constructor takes the name of the env var directly
  const db = new PrismaRuntime("db", "POSTGRES");
  // ...
});
```

      </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">
            { /*  */}

```python
# new imports
from typegraph.providers.prisma import PrismaRuntime

@typegraph()
def roadmap(g: Graph):
    # ..

    # the constructor takes the name of the env var directly
    db = PrismaRuntime("db", "POSTGRES")
    # ..

```
      </TabItem>
                </SDKTabs>

One of the features that the Prisma runtime allows us to implement is relationships. Here, we are creating a one to many relationship between bucket and ideas, also another one to many between ideas and vote. We will be specifiying relationships by using the `t.list` List type and `g.ref`(method which accepts the name of the model/entity as a parameter) for creating the link. Check the example below for better understanding. 


        <SDKTabs>
                      <TabItem value="typescript">
                            { /**/}

```typescript
import { PrismaRuntime } from "@typegraph/sdk/providers/prisma.js";

typegraph("roadmap", (g) => {
  // ...
  
  const db = new PrismaRuntime("db", "POSTGRES");

  const bucket = t.struct({
    "id": t.integer({}, { 
      asId: true, 
      //  auto generate ids during creation
      config: { auto: true }
    }),
    "name": t.string(),
    // one-to many relationship
    "ideas": t.list(g.ref("idea")), 
  })
    // explicitly naming our types makes reference later easier
    .rename("bucket"); 
  
  const idea = t.struct({
    "id": t.uuid({ asId: true, config: { auto: true } }),
    "name": t.string(),
    "authorEmail": t.email(),
    // we need to specify the relationships on both types
    "bucket": g.ref("bucket"), 
    "votes": t.list(g.ref("vote")),
  })
    .rename("idea");

  const vote = t.struct({
    "id": t.uuid({ asId: true, config: { auto: true } }),
    "authorEmail": t.email(),
    "importance": t.enum_(["medium", "important", "critical"]).optional(),
    "desc": t.string().optional(),
    "idea": g.ref("idea")
  })
    .rename("vote");

  // ...
});
```

      </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">
            { /*  */}

```python
from typegraph.providers.prisma import PrismaRuntime

@typegraph()
def roadmap(g: Graph):
    # ..
    db = PrismaRuntime("db", "POSTGRES")

    bucket = t.struct(
        {
            "id": t.integer(
              as_id=True, 
              # auto generate ids during creation
              config={"auto": True}
            ),
            "name": t.string(),
            # one-to many relationship
            "ideas": t.list(g.ref("idea")), 
        },
        # explicitly naming our types makes reference later easier
        name="bucket"  
    )
    idea = t.struct(
        {
            "id": t.uuid(as_id=True, config={"auto": True}),
            "name": t.string(),
            "authorEmail": t.email(),
            "votes": t.list(g.ref("vote")),
            "bucket": g.ref("bucket"), 
        },
        name="idea"
    )
    vote = t.struct(
        {
            "id": t.uuid(as_id=True, config={"auto": True}),
            "authorEmail": t.email(),
            "importance": t.enum(["medium", "important", "critical"]).optional(),
            "desc": t.string().optional(),
            "idea": g.ref("idea"),
        },
        name="vote"
    )
    # ..
```
      </TabItem>
                </SDKTabs>

`g.ref` declares logical relationships between our types which the Prisma runtime will be able to pick up.
If you need more control on what the relationships will look like on the database, you can use the `db.link` function.
More information can be found on the Prisma runtime [reference](/docs/reference/runtimes/prisma).

When we save our file at this point, the `meta dev` watcher should automatically create and push the necessary migrations to our database to get it in its intended shape.
You should see a new subdirectory in your project called `prisma`.
It's where the generated migrations are contained.

If you mess something up in the migrations and want a clean slate, you can reset everything by recreating the containers like so:

```bash
# remove all containers and their volumes
docker compose down -v 
# launch 
docker compose up --detach
# meta dev will auto apply any pending changes to databases
meta dev
```

At this point, we're ready to add functions to expose database queries to create or read data.
The Prisma runtime allows us to run raw queries directly on the database but it also provides handy functions we can use for basic CRUD operations.
We'll make use of those.


        <SDKTabs>
                      <TabItem value="typescript">
                            { /**/}

```typescript
import { PrismaRuntime } from "@typegraph/sdk/providers/prisma.js";

typegraph("roadmap", (g) => {
  // ...
  const pub = Policy.public(); 
  const db = new PrismaRuntime("db", "POSTGRES");
  // ...
  g.expose(
    {
      "get_buckets": db.findMany(bucket),
      "create_bucket": db.create(bucket),
      "get_idea": db.findFirst(idea),
      "create_ideas": db.create(idea),
    }, pub // make all functions public by default
  );
});
```

      </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">
            { /*  */}

```python
from typegraph.providers.prisma import PrismaRuntime

@typegraph()
def roadmap(g: Graph):
    # ..
    pub = Policy.public()
    db = PrismaRuntime("db", "POSTGRES")
    # ..
    g.expose(
        pub, # make all functions public by default
        get_buckets=db.find_many(bucket),
        create_bucket=db.create(bucket),
        get_idea=db.find_many(bucket),
        create_idea=db.create(bucket),
        get_vote=db.create(vote),
    )

```
      </TabItem>
                </SDKTabs>

We should be able to add a few buckets and ideas now.

    <TGExample
      typegraph="roadmap-prisma"
      python={require("../../../../examples/typegraphs/prisma.py")}
      typescript={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/prisma.ts")}
      query={require("./prisma.graphql")}
    />

## Policies

We now have the tools enough to allow coarse CRUD of our data.
The next thing we usually add at this point is authorization. 
A way to control who can read or write what.
The primary mechanism typegraphs use for this purpose are policies.

Policies are small functions that get the context of a request as input and return a boolean signaling weather access should be granted.

Metatype currently supports policies based on javascript functions that are run on the Deno runtime.

For this tutorial, we'll be making use of the basic auth extractor.
It expects a string in the format "Basic token" to be set in the `Authorization` http header.
The token is expected to be a base64 encoded string in the format `username:secret`.

        <SDKTabs>
                      <TabItem value="typescript">
                            { /**/}

```typescript
import { DenoRuntime } from "@typegraph/sdk/runtimes/deno.js";
import { Auth } from "@typegraph/sdk/params.js";

typegraph("roadmap", (g) => {
  // ...

  const deno = new DenoRuntime();

  // The basic extractor only populates the context when 
  // it recognizes the username and the secret matches
  g.auth(Auth.basic(["andim", /*more users*/]))

  // the `username` value is only availaible if the basic
  // extractor was successful 
  const admins = deno.policy("admins", `
  (_args, { context }) => !!context.username
`);

  g.expose(
    {
      // ..
      // only admins are allowed to create new buckets
      "create_bucket": db.create(bucket).withPolicy(admins),
      // ..
    }, pub
  );

  // ...

});
```

      </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">
            { /*  */}

```python
from typegraph.providers.prisma import PrismaRuntime
from typegraph.graph.params import Auth

@typegraph()
def roadmap(g: Graph):
    # ..
    # The basic extractor only populates the context when 
    # it recognizes the username and the secret matches
    g.auth(Auth.basic(["andim"]))

    deno = DenoRuntime()

    # the username value is only available if the basic
    # extractor was successful 
    admins = deno.policy("admins", """
  (_args, { context }) => !!context.username
""")

    g.expose(
        pub,
        # ..
        # only admins are allowed to create new buckets
        create_bucket=db.create(bucket).with_policy(admins),
        # ..
    )

```
      </TabItem>
                </SDKTabs>

The basic extractors expects the secrets in environment variables named in a specific format.
Add the following entries to the `metatype.yaml` file:

```yaml
typegates:
  dev:
    # ..
    secrets:
      roadmap:  # your typegraph name
        # ..
        # the basic extractor secret format
        # BASIC_[username] 
        BASIC_ADMIN: hunter2
```

When you save the files, meta-cli will reload the new additions to your typegraph.
`create_bucket` is now only accessible to requests bearing the right tokens
(For the provided example, `Basic YW5kaW06aHVudGVyMg==` should work).
If you are using the GraphiQl interface from earlier, there should be a panel in the bottom left called "Headers" for setting http headers 


    <TGExample
      typegraph="roadmap-policies"
      python={require("../../../../examples/typegraphs/policies.py")}
      typescript={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/policies.ts")}
      query={require("./policies.graphql")}
    />

## More Customization for our app

### Preventing Unauthorized Creation of Related Objects

**Reference**: [Parameter transformations](/docs/reference/types/parameter-transformations)

By default, Prisma generates types that supports the whole suite of usecases one might have on a CRUD operation such as allowing creation of objects of related types in a single operation.
We don't always want this and in our case, we want to prevent users from being able to create buckets, which are protected, through the `create_idea` function which's public.
We can use the `reduce` method to modify the input types of functions.


```graphql
mutation CIdea {
  create_idea(
    data: {
      # we want to prevent bucket creation through `create_idea`
      bucket: {
        create: {name: "Backlog"}
      }, 
      authorEmail: "asdf@as.df", 
      name: "Add support for WASM GC"
    }
  ) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

Even though the `reduce` method doesn't allow us to change the shape of the type, we can change the types of members and importantly here, hide the ones we don't need.

Requests are now only able to `connect` new ideas with pre-existing buckets and won't be able to create them.
If you try to `create` new bucket through `create_idea`, the typgate will return this response.
```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Unexpected property 'create' for argument 'data.bucket' of type 'object' ('object_288') at create_idea; valid properties are: connect",
      "locations": [],
      "path": [],
      "extensions": {
        "timestamp": "2024-04-21T09:46:33.177Z"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Instead, If you try using this mutation, it will work as expected. You can only specify buckets that are already created.
```graphql
mutation {
  create_idea(
    data: {
      # we want to prevent bucket creation through `create_idea`
      bucket: {
        connect: {id: 1}
      }, 
      authorEmail: "asdf@as.df", 
      name: "Add support for WASM GC"
    }
  ) {
    id
    name,
    bucket {
      id,
      name
    }
  }
}
```

    <TGExample
      typegraph="roadmap-reduce"
      python={require("../../../../examples/typegraphs/reduce.py")}

      query={require("./reduce.graphql")}
    />

### Restrict Update Operation on Selected Fields

You'll notice that we had set the `importance` field on votes as optional.
This is to allow users to just up-vote an idea from the main list without opening a form.
If they want to add importance or a description to their vote at a later point, we want to update their already existing vote.
It should be easy to expose a function for this using Prisma's `db.update` helper and `reduce` to restrict changes to only those field.
But we'll take this opportunity to explore the feature of the Prisma runtime to execute raw queries.

```python
from typegraph.gen.exports.runtimes import EffectUpdate

@typegraph()
def roadmap(g: Graph):
    # ..
    g.expose(
        pub,
        # ..
        set_vote_importance=db.execute(

Our query is exposed like any other function in the GraphQl api.

    <TGExample
      typegraph="roadmap-execute"
      python={require("../../../../examples/typegraphs/execute.py")}
      typescript={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/execute.ts")}
      query={require("./execute.graphql")}
    />

### Creating REST endpoints

We can easily expose an HTTP API for our typegraph using the `g.rest` method.
It takes a string describe a graphql query to be executed when the http path is requested.

                            { /**/}

```typescript
typegraph("roadmap", (g) => {
  // ...
  
  g.rest(
    `
        query get_buckets {
            get_buckets {
                id
                name
                ideas {
                    id
                    name
                    authorEmail
                }
            }
        }
    `
  )
  g.rest(
    // query parameters present
    // expects a request of the type `roadmap/rest/get_bucket?id=uuidstr`
    `
        query get_bucket($id: Integer) {
            get_bucket(where:{
                id: $id
            }) {

                    authorEmail
                }
            }
        }
    `

});

The exposed query is served at the path `{typegate_url}/{typegraph_name}/rest/{query_name}`.
Any parameters that the query takes are processed from the search params of the request. You can check this [link](http://localhost:7890/roadmap/rest/get_buckets) on your local machine and check the results.
