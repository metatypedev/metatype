# Your chat app

Back to your typegraph for the chat-based app. You learn all keys components and it's time to implement the business logic.

## External typescript function

The Deno runtime can register external files for longer functions. You can use the meta CLI to generate the types once the `ModuleMat` has been defined in your typegraph: `meta codegen deno -f typegraph.py`.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">
  {require("!!code-loader!./business-logic.ts")}
</CodeBlock>

## Connecting the pieces together

Take the learning of the last sections and use at your advantage the internal policies allowing to made calls within the Deno runtime and keeping the same context.

<TGExample
  typegraph="business-logic"
  python={require("./business-logic.py")}
  query={require("./business-logic.graphql")}
/>

That's it, you just developed chat-based API block for your app - naive for sure, but covering most of the feature of Metatype.
