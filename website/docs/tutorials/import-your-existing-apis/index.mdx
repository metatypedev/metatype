# Import your existing APIs

Let's summarize how far you progress made towards the chat-based app. The APIs should offer the following functionalities:

- list messages âœ…
- create a message âœ…
- retrieve the user from a message âœ…
- send a notification to all users when there is a new message ðŸ•£
- authentication and rate-limit the call ðŸ•£
- add access control management ðŸ•£
- some business logic ðŸ•£

For the notifications, Google offer a [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/fcm/rest) (FCM) API which supports push on iOS, Android and web. Sadly as most of Google service, they don't provide an OpenAPI specification or a friendly GraphQL API. Rather they developed their own API definition files called API Discovery Service which maps incoming REST request onto their internal GRPC implementation, but this is a digression.

## Google importers

The typegraph module comes with some handy importers to avoid having to rewrite manually all types and materializers. Currently, it supports importers for OpenAPI, GraphQL API and Google APIs.

:::caution Beta/unstable feature
Importers are quite recent and likely to evolve as feedback is received. Your voice and use cases matter a lot, let Metatype community know what suits you the best in this [discussion](https://github.com/metatypedev/metatype/discussions/104).
:::

Importers are function call with a boolean re-writing the source code file where they live. As they can generate quite long type definition, the best practice is to separate them into a dedicated file that can be imported into your main typegraph. Let's create `google.py` and run `python google.py` to generate the types.

<CodeBlock language="python">{require("./importer.py").content}</CodeBlock>

This should generate code similar to this:

<CodeBlock language="python">{require("./google.py").content}</CodeBlock>

And can be imported/customized in your main typegraph file:

<TGExample
  typegraph="fcm"
  python={require("./fcm.py")}
  query={require("./fcm.graphql")}
/>

## Effects

Effects are a property of materializers and help categorization what happens to data when it gets transformed. Although they are similar to REST verbs and SQL statements, there is no direct one-to-one mapping.

| Effects  | REST verbs | SQL statements       |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| `none`   | GET        | `SELECT`             |
| `create` | POST       | `INSERT`             |
| `update` | PUT/PATCH  | `UPDATE`             |
| `upsert` | PUT        | `INSERT ON CONFLICT` |
| `delete` | DELETE     | `DELETE`             |

They provide hints to the typegates for the query orchestration by splitting the queries and mutations. For example, the `create` effect is exposed as a mutation. They also allow setting different policies based on them, that's for the next page.
