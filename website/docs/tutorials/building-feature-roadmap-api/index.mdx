# Build a feature roadmap API

**This page will walk you through a real world API with data storage and authorization.**

:::note You will learn

- how to setup your development for metatype projects
- how to run the typegate on the docker runtime
- how to create/read/update/delete data
- how to write custom business logic
- how to authenticate requests
- how to protect data with policies

:::

## What are you building?

For this tutorial, we'll be implementing an API to power a simple feature roadmap/request hybrid as can be seen on [Productlane](https://productlane.com/roadmap).

Looking through the app we can see tha the api should allow:
 - Unauthenticated users to submit new "ideas" or vote on any of those already listed.
 - Specify or vote on the importance of an "idea" from "medium" to "critical" or even submit text with more description.
 - Admins will be able to move ideas across buckets like "Backlog", "Planned", "In Progress".

        {/* TODO: consider emailing people interested in an idea when things change */}

## Setup

Before anything, we'll first need to install the tooling required for development and create a new project. 

### Install Meta CLI

The meta-cli tool manages and helps you develop your metatype based projects. 
This include allowing you to run them locally for development, push them to production in the cloud, managing your database migrations and more.

        <InstallMetaCli />

### Create a new project

Metatype projects are composed of modular bundles of types, logic and policies called typegraphs.
We author typegraphs using modern programming languages & environments. 
Python and ECMAScript are currently availaible for use.
The meta-cli allows us to create a new project based on pre-existing templates.


        <SDKTabs>
              <TabItem value="typescript">
              {/**/}

Run one the following commands to create a new project under a new directory titled `tg_roadmap`.

```bash
# using Node/Bun runtimes
meta new --template node tg_roadmap 
#                        ^ project name 
#                   ^  Use `meta new --help` find out more available templates. 

# using Deno
meta new --template deno tg_roadmap 
```

When using ECMAScript, the `@typegraph/sdk` package exposes all the necessary functions and types we'll need to describe our typegraph.
The templates already specify it as as a dependency so all we need to do now is run the following command to download it:

```bash
# using Deno
deno cache api/example.ts # cache dependencies

# using Bun
bun install

# using pnpm
pnpm install

# using npm
npm install

# using yarn
yarn install
```

      </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">

          {/**/}
Run the following command to create a new project under a new directory titled `tg_roadmap`.

```bash
meta new --template python tg_roadmap 
#                          ^ project name 
#                   ^  Use `meta new --help` find out more available templates. 
```

When using python, the `typegraph` package exposes all the necessary functions and types we'll need to describe our typegraph.
We'll need to run the following command to install it:

```bash
# virtual env
python3 -m venv .venv
# other activate scripts should be available for non bash shells
source .venv/bin/activate 

# using pip
pip3 install typegraph

# using poetry
# the template has included `typegraph` in the poetry manifest
poetry install 
```

      </TabItem>
          </SDKTabs>

### Launch typegate

The typegate is a program that runs and orchestrates our typegraphs.
We can run it locally for development purposes.
Typegate currently requires the Redis database to function and to make it eay to run both, we'll make use of a linux container runtime for this. 
The Docker runtime to be specific which has installation guides located [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

We'll also need the Docker Compose orchestrator which usually comes by default with the `docker` command. Use the following command to check if it's available:

```bash
docker compose version 
# Docker Compose version 2.23.0
```

...and if not, the official installation guide can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

If you have your docker runtime installed and running correctly, you will be able to launch the `compose.yml` file that's bundled in every template.
The compose file by default includes the `postgres` and `mongo` databases.
You can disable the latter by commenting it out or removing it as we'll not be needing it for this tutorial. 

To launch the services, navigate you shell the the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up --detach
#                 ^ detach means it'll run in the background.
#                   Omit to get the all logs in the current terminal
```

This should download and start typegate and it's dependent services. 

We can observe their log of typegate or any of the other services with the following command. It has to be run from the same project directory.

```bash
docker compose logs typegate --follow
#                   ^ Omit service name to look at the combined logs of all services
```

### Make sure it's all working

The meta-cli includes the `doctor` command that checks everything is in working order. 
You can run the following to make sure everything's up and running. 

```bash
meta doctor
# ——————————————————————————— Global ———————————————————————————
# curr. directory      /home/asdf/tg_roadmap

## Types

The types of our typegraph describe the shape of the data that flows through it.
In this case, we'll build our typegraph around types that represent "ideas", "votes" and "buckets".


        <SDKTabs>
              <TabItem value="typescript">
              {/**/}
Modify the file at `api/example.ts` to look something like the following. 

```typescript
// we'll need the following imports
import { t, typegraph } from "@typegraph/sdk";


typegraph("roadmap", (g) => {
  //       ^ each typegraph has a name

  const bucket = t.struct({
    // asId and other config items describe the logical properties
    // of our types beyond just the shape
    "id": t.integer({}, { asId: true }),
    "name": t.string(),
  });
  const idea = t.struct({
    // uuid is just a shorthand alias for `t.string({format: "uuid"})`
    "id": t.uuid({ asId: true }), 
    "name": t.string(),
    // another string shorthand
    "authorEmail": t.email(), 
  });
  const vote = t.struct({
    "id": t.uuid(),
    "authorEmail": t.email(),
    // `enum_` is also a shorthand over `t.string`
    "importance": t.enum_(["medium", "important", "critical"]).optional(), 
    // makes it optional
    "desc": t.string().optional(), 
  });
});
```

      </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">
          {/**/}
Modify the file at `api/example.py` to look something like the following. 

```python
# we'll need the following imports
from typegraph import typegraph, t, Graph

# the typegraph will carry the name of the defining function by default
@typegraph()
def roadmap(g: Graph):
    bucket = t.struct({
        # asId and other config items describe the logical properties
        # of our types beyond just the shape
        "id": t.integer(as_id=True),
        "name": t.string(),
    });
    idea = t.struct({
        # email is just a shorthand alias for `t.string({format: "uuid"})`
        "id": t.uuid(as_id=True), 
        "name": t.string(),
        # another string shorthand
        "authorEmail": t.email(), 
    });
    vote = t.struct({
        "id": t.uuid(),
        "authorEmail": t.email(),
        # `enum` is also a shorthand over `t.string`
        "importance": t.enum(["medium", "important", "critical"]).optional(), 
        # makes it optional
        "desc": t.string().optional(), 
    });

```
      </TabItem>
          </SDKTabs>

The types here are very simple and we haven't yet added any thing that models their relationships but they should do for our purposes.

## Materializers

Typegraphs expose an API to the external world using Materializer objects.
Materializers describe functions that transform some input type into an output type and we define them in scope of different Runtimes, where the actual logic runs. 
At this early stage, we can make use of the Random runtime which allows us to generate random test data for our types to get a feel of our API. 


        <SDKTabs>
              <TabItem value="typescript">
              {/**/}

```typescript
// add need the following imports
import { RandomRuntime } from "@typegraph/sdk/runtimes/random";

typegraph("roadmap", (g) => {
  // ...
  // every exposed materializer requires access control policies
  // for now, just use the public policy, anyone can access it 
  const pub = Policy.public(); 
  const random = new RandomRuntime({});
  g.expose(
    {
      // generates a random object in the shape of idea
      "get_idea": random.gen(idea).withPolicy(pub),
    },
  );
});
```

      </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">
          {/*  */}
```python
from typegraph.runtimes.random import RandomRuntime

@typegraph()
def roadmap(g: Graph):
    # every exposed materializer requires access control policies
    # for now, just use the public policy, anyone can access it
    pub = Policy.public() 
    random = RandomRuntime()
    g.expose(
      # generates a random object in the shape of idea
      get_idea=random.gen(idea).with_policy(pub)
    )

```
      </TabItem>
          </SDKTabs>
At this point, we can push our typegraph to the locally running typegate node and access it.
Run the following command in your project root:

```bash
# features auto-reload on any changes to your source files
meta dev 
```

Typegate has first-class support for consuming the API through a GraphQl interface and it's enabled by default.
It also bundles the GrahpiQl API explorer and you should be able to access it at [http://localhost:7890/roadmap](http://localhost:7890/roadmap) once meta-cli has successfully pushed your typegraph.


    <TGExample
          typegraph="roadmap-random"
          python={require("../../../../examples/typegraphs/random.py")}
          typescript={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/random.ts")}
          query={require("./random.graphql")}
        />

### The Prisma Runtime

A runtime most apps will be depend on is the [Prisma Runtime](/docs/reference/runtimes/prisma).
It allows you to persist data and run queries on different kinds of databases and has support for popular SQL and NoSQL databases.
We'll use it to add the CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations our app needs.

For this tutorial, we'll be making use of the PostgreSQL database. 
If you made use of the `compose.yml` to run typegate as outlined in this tutorial, there should be an instance of Postgres already up.
You can check if postgres container is currently running by using the `meta doctor` command.

If a typegraph needs to access a database, it first needs to be made aware of its address.
This is done through environment variables. 
In the root of your project directory, you'll find a file titled `metatype.yaml`.
It contains metatype specific configuration for our project such as the top level `typegates` object which we use to specify the location and credentials of the different typegate nodes we'll be using.
Each typegate entry also takes an `env` object where we can specify environment variables to be passed to our typegraphs.
This requires special syntax.
If we want for a typegraph called, say `FOO`, to be able read a variable named `BAR`, we specify the variable as `TG_FOO_BAR: value` in our config.


The `metatype.yaml` should already have a few sample environment variables. 
Add an entry like the following to give our typegraph access to the database's address:

```yaml
typegates:
  dev:
    # ..
    env:
      # values here assume default config
      TG_ROADMAP_POSTGRES: "postgresql://postgres:password@postgres:5432/db"
```

Meta-cli will auto-reload when it detects changes to `metatype.yaml`.

We can add the Prisma runtime to our typegraph now.


        <SDKTabs>
              <TabItem value="typescript">
              {/**/}

```typescript
// new imports
import { PrismaRuntime } from "@typegraph/sdk/providers/prisma";

typegraph("roadmap", (g) => {
  // ...
  
  // the constructor takes the name of the env var directly
  const db = new PrismaRuntime("db", "POSTGRES");
  // ...
});
```

      </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">
          {/*  */}

```python
# new imports
from typegraph.providers.prisma import PrismaRuntime

@typegraph()
def roadmap(g: Graph):
    # ..

    # the constructor takes the name of the env var directly
    db = PrismaRuntime("db", "POSTGRES")
    # ..

```
      </TabItem>
          </SDKTabs>

One of the features that the Prisma runtime allows us to implement is relationships.


        <SDKTabs>
              <TabItem value="typescript">
              {/**/}

```typescript
import { PrismaRuntime } from "@typegraph/sdk/providers/prisma";

typegraph("roadmap", (g) => {
  // ...
  
  const db = new PrismaRuntime("db", "POSTGRES");

  const bucket = t.struct({
    "id": t.integer({}, { 
      asId: true, 
      //  auto generate ids during creation
      config: { auto: true }
    }),
    "name": t.string(),
    // one-to many relationship
    "ideas": t.list(g.ref("idea")), 
  })
    // explicitly naming our types makes reference later easier
    .rename("bucket"); 
  
  const idea = t.struct({
    "id": t.uuid({ asId: true, config: { auto: true } }),
    "name": t.string(),
    "authorEmail": t.email(),
    // we need to specify the relationships on both types
    "bucket": g.ref("bucket"), 
    "votes": t.list(g.ref("vote")),
  })
    .rename("idea");

  const vote = t.struct({
    "id": t.uuid({ asId: true, config: { auto: true } }),
    "authorEmail": t.email(),
    "importance": t.enum_(["medium", "important", "critical"]).optional(),
    "desc": t.string().optional(),
    "idea": g.ref("idea")
  })
    .rename("vote");

  // ...
});
```

      </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">
          {/*  */}

```python
from typegraph.providers.prisma import PrismaRuntime

@typegraph()
def roadmap(g: Graph):
    # ..
    db = PrismaRuntime("db", "POSTGRES")

    bucket = t.struct(
        {
            "id": t.integer(
              as_id=True, 
              # auto generate ids during creation
              config={"auto": True}
            ),
            "name": t.string(),
            # one-to many relationship
            "ideas": t.list(g.ref("idea")), 
        },
        # explicitly naming our types makes reference later easier
        name="bucket"  
    )
    idea = t.struct(
        {
            "id": t.uuid(as_id=True, config={"auto": True}),
            "name": t.string(),
            "authorEmail": t.email(),
            "votes": t.list(g.ref("vote")),
            "bucket": g.ref("bucket"), 
        },
        name="idea"
    )
    vote = t.struct(
        {
            "id": t.uuid(as_id=True, config={"auto": True}),
            "authorEmail": t.email(),
            "importance": t.enum(["medium", "important", "critical"]).optional(),
            "desc": t.string().optional(),
            "idea": g.ref("idea"),
        },
        name="vote"
    )
    # ..
```
      </TabItem>
          </SDKTabs>

`g.ref` declares logical relationships between our types which the Prisma runtime will be able to pick up.
If you need more control on what the relationships will look like on the database, you can use the `db.link` function.
More information can be found on the Prisma runtime [reference](/docs/reference/runtimes/prisma).

When we save our file at this point, the `meta dev` watcher should automatically create and push the necessary migrations to our database to get it in its intended shape.
You should see a new subdirectory in your project called `prisma`.
It's where the generated migrations are contained.

If you mess something up in the migrations and want a clean slate, you can reset everything by recreating the containers like so:

```bash
# remove all containers and their volumes
docker compose down -v 
# launch 
docker compose up --detach
# meta dev will auto apply any pending changes to databases
meta dev
```

At this point, we're ready to add materializers to expose database queries to create or read data.
The Prisma runtime allows us to run raw queries directly on the database but it also provides handy functions we can use for basic CRUD operations.
We'll make use of those.


        <SDKTabs>
              <TabItem value="typescript">
              {/**/}

```typescript
import { PrismaRuntime } from "@typegraph/sdk/providers/prisma";

typegraph("roadmap", (g) => {
  // ...
  const pub = Policy.public(); 
  const db = new PrismaRuntime("db", "POSTGRES");
  // ...
  g.expose(
    {
      "get_buckets": db.findMany(bucket),
      "create_bucket": db.create(bucket),
      "get_idea": db.findFirst(idea),
      "create_ideas": db.create(idea),
    }, pub // make all materializers public by default
  );
});
```

      </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">
          {/*  */}

```python
from typegraph.providers.prisma import PrismaRuntime

@typegraph()
def roadmap(g: Graph):
    # ..
    pub = Policy.public()
    db = PrismaRuntime("db", "POSTGRES")
    # ..
    g.expose(
        pub, # make all materializers public by default
        get_buckets=db.find_many(bucket),
        create_bucket=db.create(bucket),
        get_idea=db.find_many(bucket),
        create_idea=db.create(bucket),
        get_vote=db.create(vote),
    )

```
      </TabItem>
          </SDKTabs>

We should be able to add a few buckets and ideas now.

    <TGExample
          typegraph="roadmap-prisma"
          python={require("../../../../examples/typegraphs/prisma.py")}
          typescript={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/prisma.ts")}
          query={require("./prisma.graphql")}
        />

## Policies

We now have the tools enough to allow coarse CRUD of our data.
The next thing we usually add at this point is authorization. 
A way to control who can read or write what.
The primary mechanism typegraphs use for this purpose are policies.

Policies are small functions that get the context of a request as input and return a boolean signaling weather access should be granted.
There are different kinds of extractors available that primarily work on HTTP request headers including `jwt`, `hmac`, `basic` and `oauth2` with support for different providers. 
We register any extractors we're interested in for the entire typegraph.
Any policies running within it can then access their extracted values in the context.  
Metatype currently supports policies based on javascript functions that are run on the Deno runtime.

For this tutorial, we'll be making use of the basic auth extractor.
It expects a string in the format "Basic token" to be set in the `Authorization` http header.
The token is expected to be a base64 encoded string in the format `username:secret`.

        <SDKTabs>
              <TabItem value="typescript">
              {/**/}

```typescript
import { DenoRuntime } from "@typegraph/sdk/runtimes/deno";
import { Auth } from "@typegraph/sdk/params";

typegraph("roadmap", (g) => {
  // ...

  const deno = new DenoRuntime();

  // The basic extractor only populates the context when 
  // it recognizes the username and the secret matches
  g.auth(Auth.basic(["andim", /*more users*/]))

  // the `username` value is only availaible if the basic
  // extractor was successful 
  const admins = deno.policy("admins", `
  (_args, { context }) => !!context.username
`);

  g.expose(
    {
      // ..
      // only admins are allowed to create new buckets
      "create_bucket": db.create(bucket).withPolicy(admins),
      // ..
    }, pub
  );

  // ...

});
```

      </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">
          {/*  */}

```python
from typegraph.providers.prisma import PrismaRuntime
from typegraph.graph.params import Auth

@typegraph()
def roadmap(g: Graph):
    # ..
    # The basic extractor only populates the context when 
    # it recognizes the username and the secret matches
    g.auth(Auth.basic(["andim"]))

    deno = DenoRuntime()

    # the username value is only availaible if the basic
    # extractor was successful 
    admins = deno.policy("admins", """
  (_args, { context }) => !!context.username
""")

    g.expose(
        pub,
        # ..
        # only admins are allowed to create new buckets
        create_bucket=db.create(bucket).with_policy(admins),
        # ..
    )

```
      </TabItem>
          </SDKTabs>

The basic extractors expects the secrets in environment variables named in a specific format.
Add the following entries to the `metatype.yaml` file:

```yaml
typegates:
  dev:
    # ..
    env:
      # ..
      # the basic extractor secret format
      # TG_[typegraph]_BASIC_[username] 
      TG_ROADMAP_BASIC_ANDIM: hunter2
```

When you save the files, meta-cli will reload the new additions to your typegraph.
`create_bucket` is now only accessible to requests bearing the right tokens. 
(For the provided example, `Basic YW5kaW06aHVudGVyMg==` should work)
If you're using the GraphiQl interface from earlier, there should be a panel in the bottom left called "Headers" for setting http headers 


    <TGExample
          typegraph="roadmap-policies"
          python={require("../../../../examples/typegraphs/roadmap-policies.py")}
          typescript={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/roadmap-policies.ts")}
          query={require("./policies.graphql")}
        />

## More

### `reduce`

We can use the `reduce` method to modify the input types of functions.
This comes especially handy when dealing with generated functions like those from the CRUD helpers from the Prisma runtime.
By default, Prisma generates types that supports the whole suite of usecases one might have on a CRUD operation such as allowing creation of objects of related types in a single operation.
We don't always want this and in our case, we want to prevent users from being able to create buckets, which are protected, through the `create_idea` materializer which's public.

```graphql
mutation CIdea {
  create_idea(
    data: {
      # we want to prevent bucket creation through `create_idea`
      bucket: {
        create: {name: "Backlog"}
      }, 
      authorEmail: "asdf@as.df", 
      name: "Add support for WASM GC"
    }
  ) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

Even though the `reduce` method doesn't allow us to change the shape of the type, we can change the types of members and importantly here, hide the ones we don't need.

              <TabItem value="typescript">
              {/**/}

```typescript
typegraph("roadmap", (g) => {
  // ...
  g.expose(
    {
      // ..
      "create_idea": db.create(idea).reduce({
        "data": {
          // `g.inherit` specifies that we keep the member 
          // type of the original 
          "name": g.inherit(),
          "authorEmail": g.inherit(),
          "votes": g.inherit(),
          "bucket": {
            "connect": g.inherit(),
            // by omitting the `create` member, we hide it
          }
        }
      }),
      // ..
    }, pub
  );

});
```

      </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">
          {/*  */}

```python
@typegraph()
def roadmap(g: Graph):
    # ..
    g.expose(
        pub,
        # ..
        create_idea=db.create(idea).reduce({
            "data": {
                # `g.inherit` specifies that we keep the member 
                # type of the original
                "name": g.inherit(),
                "authorEmail": g.inherit(),
                "votes": g.inherit(),
                "bucket": {
                    "connect": g.inherit(),
                    # by omitting the `create` member, we hide it
                }
            }
        }),
        # ..
    )

```
      </TabItem>
          </SDKTabs>

Requests are now only able to `connect` new ideas with pre-existing buckets and won't be able to create them.

    <TGExample
          typegraph="roadmap-reduce"
          python={require("../../../../examples/typegraphs/reduce.py")}
          typescript={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/reduce.ts")}
          query={require("./reduce.graphql")}
        />

### `execute`

You'll notice that we had set the `importance` field on votes as optional.
This is to allow users to just up-vote an idea from the main list without opening a form.
If they want to add importance or a description to their vote at a later point, we want to update their already existing vote.
It should be easy to expose a materializer for this using Prisma's `db.update` helper and `reduce` to restrict changes to only those field.
But we'll take this opportunity to explore the feature of the Prisma runtime to execute raw queries.


        <SDKTabs>
              <TabItem value="typescript">
              {/**/}

```typescript
import * as effects from "@typegraph/sdk/effects";

typegraph("roadmap", (g) => {
  // ...
  g.expose(
    {
      // ..
      "set_vote_importance": db.execute(
        // query parameters are matched by name from the input type
        'UPDATE "vote" SET importance = ${importance} WHERE id = ${vote_id}::uuid',
        // our input type
        t.struct({
          "vote_id": t.uuid(),
          "importance": t.enum_(["medium", "important", "critical"]),
        }),
        // we use effects to signal what kind of operation we're doing
        // updates and creates will be exposed as mutations in GraphQl
        // the boolean signals that the query is idempotent
        effects.update(true), 
      )
      // ..
    }, pub
  );

});
```

      </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">
          {/*  */}

```python
from typegraph.gen.exports.runtimes import EffectUpdate

@typegraph()
def roadmap(g: Graph):
    # ..
    g.expose(
        pub,
        # ..
        set_vote_importance=db.execute(
            # query parameters are matched by name from the input typ
            'UPDATE "vote" SET importance = ${importance} WHERE id = ${vote_id}::uuid',
            # our input type
            t.struct({
                "vote_id": t.uuid(),
                "importance": t.enum(["medium", "important", "critical"]),
            }),
            # we use effects to signal what kind of operation we're doing
            # updates and creates will be exposed as mutations in GraphQl
            # the boolean signals that the query is idempotent
            EffectUpdate(True),
        ),
        # ..
    )

```
      </TabItem>
          </SDKTabs>

Our query is exposed like any other materializer in the GraphQl api.

    <TGExample
          typegraph="roadmap-execute"
          python={require("../../../../examples/typegraphs/execute.py")}
          typescript={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/execute.ts")}
          query={require("./execute.graphql")}
        />

### `rest`

We can easily expose an HTTP API for our typegraph using the `g.rest` method.
It takes a string describe a graphql query to be executed when the http path is requested.

        <SDKTabs>
              <TabItem value="typescript">
              {/**/}

```typescript
typegraph("roadmap", (g) => {
  // ...
  
  g.rest(
    `
        query get_buckets {
            get_buckets {
                id
                name
                ideas {
                    id
                    name
                    authorEmail
                }
            }
        }
    `
  )
  g.rest(
    // query parameters present
    // expects a request of the type `roadmap/rest/get_bucket?id=uuidstr`
    `
        query get_bucket($id: Integer) {
            get_bucket(where:{
                id: $id
            }) {
                id
                name
                ideas {
                    id
                    name
                    authorEmail
                }
            }
        }
    `
  )
});
```

      </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">
          {/*  */}

```python
@typegraph()
def roadmap(g: Graph):
    # ..
    g.rest(
        """
        query get_buckets {
            get_buckets {
                id 
                name
                ideas {
                    id
                    name
                    authorEmail
                }
            }
        }
        """
    )
    g.rest(
        # query parameters present
        # expects a request of the type `roadmap/rest/get_bucket?id=uuidstr`
        """
        query get_bucket($id: Integer) {
            get_bucket(where:{
                id: $id
            }) {
                id 
                name
                ideas {
                    id
                    name
                    authorEmail
                }
            }
        }
        """
    )

```
      </TabItem>
          </SDKTabs>

The exposed query is served at the path `{typegate_url}/{typegraph_name}/rest/{query_name}`.
Any parameters that the query takes are processed from the search params of the request.

### `import`

So far, the materializers we've looked at have been generated by helpers like the CRUD helpers from the Prisma runtime or the the Random runtime's `generate` helper.
The `deno.policy` function we used for authoring policies was also based on function objects. 
All these helpers are shorthands for creating function objects and now we'll look at how to roll a custom function ourselves.
We'll be using the Deno runtime to run our code.

Instead of including the code inline through a string, the Deno runtime allows us to import modules from disk.
Our modules are allowed to use ESM imports to access libraries on different registries like `npm` and `deno.land`.
We'll use these features to write a simple materializer that converts markdown to html.

```typescript
import * as marked from "https://deno.land/x/marked/mod.ts";

export function parse({ raw }: { raw: string }): string {
  return marked.parse(raw);
}
```

We'll expose our module using the deno runtime.

    <SDKTabs>

              {/**/}

```typescript
typegraph("roadmap", (g) => {
  // ...
  g.expose(
    {
      // ..
      "parse_markdown": deno.import(
          t.struct({"raw": t.string()}),
          t.string(),
          {
            name: "parse",
            // the path is parsed relative to the typegraph file
            module: "md2html.ts",
          }
        ),
      // ..
    }, pub
  );
});
```

      </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">

          {/*  */}

```python
@typegraph()
def roadmap(g: Graph):
    g.expose(
        pub,
        # ..
        parse_markdown=deno.import_(
            t.struct({"raw": t.string()}),
            t.string(),
            # the path is parsed relative to the typegraph file
            module="md2html.ts",
            name="parse",
        ),
    )

```
      </TabItem>
          </SDKTabs>

We can now access our func through the GraphQl api.
    <TGExample
          typegraph="roadmap-func"
          python={require("../../../../examples/typegraphs/func.py")}
          typescript={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/func.ts")}
          query={require("./func.graphql")}
        />

    {/*
                                                     */}
    {/*
                                                     - func as a service
                                                     */}
