# Quick start

**This page will show you how to install the different components used by Metatype.**

:::note You will learn

- how to install the meta CLI
- how to install the typegraph SDK
- how to run a typegate node

:::

## 1. Meta CLI

<InstallMetaCli />

## 2. Typegraph SDK

<InstallTypegraph />

## 3. Typegate node

<InstallTypegate />

## 4. Verify your installation

The doctor subcommand will attempt to detect all the components and report any potential issue. Please make sure to run it before opening an issue and include the output in your report.

```bash
meta doctor
```

## 5. Install the development tools (Optional)

:::warning
 ðŸš§ This is a work in progress and still experimental.
:::

The development tools provide some additional real-time diagnostics
on the typegraph definition and autocompletion (WIP).

Currently, it only works for TypeScript/JavaScript typegraph definitions
and the VS Code editor.

### VS Code

VS Code users can use the [VSCode extension for Metatype](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=metatypedev.vscode-metatype).

To install it, launch VS Code Quick Open (`Ctrl+P`), paste the following command, and press enter.

```
ext install metatypedev.vscode-metatype
```

Alternatively, you can download the `.vsix` file from the
[releases page](https://github.com/metatypedev/metatype/releases)
and manually install the extension.
