# Test typegraphs

[Typegraph](/docs/reference/typegraph) is the SDK of the _Metatype_ where the app is authored and defined.
Typegraphs can be tested easily with the common test suites in the language of your choosing.

The following next lines describes how you can test your typegraph.
For _Typescript_ SDK, we will be using [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for the _Python_ SDK in this example.

<SDKTabs>

    <TabItem value="typescript">

To test typegraphs in the _typescript_ SDK, you first need to add _vitest_ as a dev dependency to your metatype project.

:::info
You can follow [this](/docs/tutorials/quick-start) link on how to bootstrap a metatype application.
:::

To install _vitest_, you can execute the command below in your terminal based on the runtime you are using for the project.

<TsPmTabs>

    <TabItem value="pnpm">
      ```bash
      pnpm add -D vitest
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="npm">
      ```bash
      npm install -D vitest
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="yarn">
      ```bash
      yarn add -D vitest
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="deno">
      ```bash
      import { ... } from "npm:vitest";
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="bun">
      ```bash
      bun add -D vitest
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="jsr">
      ```bash
      # vitest currently not in jsr registry
      ```
    </TabItem>

</TsPmTabs>

After you have installed _vitest_, your project is setup for some tests. Create a test `tg.test.ts` in `/tests` directory from the root project dir. _vitest_ discovers tests by file names, so ensure that your test names follow the following format below.

```bash
**/*.test.ts
**/*.spec.ts
```

For this example, the template typegraph generated from the `meta new` command is used, which is the one down below.

```typescript
...

export const tg = typegraph("example", (g) => {
  const pub = Policy.public();
  const deno = new DenoRuntime();
  const python = new PythonRuntime();

  g.expose({
    add: python
      .fromLambda(
        t.struct({ first: t.float(), second: t.float() }),
        t.float(),
        { code: "lambda x: x['first'] + x['second']" },
      )
      .withPolicy(pub),
    multiply: deno
      .func(t.struct({ first: t.float(), second: t.float() }), t.float(), {
        code: "({first, second}) => first * second",
      })
      .withPolicy(pub),
  });
});
```

For the typegraph test file, you can write these simple test cases to check the validity of your typegraphs.

```typescript
import { assert, assertType, expect, test } from "vitest";


test("checks if typegraph output is computed", async () => {
    const tg_output = await tg;
    assertType<TypegraphOutput>(tg_output);
});

test("test if typegraph name is correct", async () => {
    const tg_output = await tg;
    assert(tg_output.name === "example", "typegraph name is correct");
});

test("test if serialize function exists", async () => {
    const tg_output = await tg;
    assertType<Function>(typeof tg_output.serialize);
});

test("test if typegraph serialization works", async () => {
    const tg_output = await tg;

    // serialize params
    const params = {
        typegraphPath: "api/example.mjs",
        prefix: "",
        artifactResolution: true,
        codegen: false,
        prismaMigration: {
        migrationsDir: "prisma-migrations",
        migrationActions: Object.entries({}),
        defaultMigrationAction: {
            apply: true,
            create: false,
            reset: false,
        },
        },
        pretty: false,
    };

    const serialized = tg_output.serialize(params);
    assert(serialized !== null, "Serialization Successful");
    assertType<TgFinalizationResult>(serialized);
});
```

Here, you can test various outputs you get from running the typegraph function. You can add more test cases to make your app robust.

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="python">
    
First, you need to add _pytest_ as a dev dependency in your project/application. 

:::info
You can follow [this](/docs/tutorials/quick-start) link on how to bootstrap a metatype application.
:::
<PyPmTabs>
    <TabItem value="pip">
    ```bash
    pip3 install pytest
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="poetry">
    ```bash
    poetry add --dev pytest
    ```
    </TabItem>
</PyPmTabs>

After successful installation, you need to activate a python venv. In poetry, you can easily activate the virtual environment using the command below.

```bash
poetry shell
```

Now, You can start writing tests for your typegraph. For convention, write the tests inside the `tests` directory under the project's root dir. 

Assuming you have this simple typegraph definition, which is a template typegraph you can generate by using the `meta new` commmand from the _Meta CLI_.

```python
...

@typegraph()
def example(g: Graph):
    public = Policy.public()
    python = PythonRuntime()

    hello = python.from_lambda(
        t.struct({"world": t.string()}),
        t.string(),
        lambda x: f"Hello {x['world']}!",
    )

    g.expose(public, hello=hello)

```

You can write the following test to check if your typegraph is correctly authored. Under `/tests` dir, create an empty test and add the test code below. Make sure you name your test file appending `_test` or prepending `test_` so pytest can discover them. 

```python
from example.api.example import example as tg
import subprocess

# running the typegraph gives a TypegraphOutput object 
tg_output = tg()

# test if the tg output is correct,
def test_tg_name():
    assert tg_output.name == "example"
    
def test_serialize_tg():
    assert callable(tg_output.serialize)

# check if the typegraph gets serialized
def test_serialize():
    command_args = [
        "meta",
        "serialize",
        "-f",
        "example/api/example.py" # tg path from the project root dir
    ]
    result = subprocess.run(command_args, capture_output=True, text=True)
    assert result.returncode == 0
```

Running the typegraph function, results in a [TypegraphOutput](https://github.com/metatypedev/metatype/blob/8cc1c129b0f858047eda8557c1bc120873d37aca/typegraph/python/typegraph/graph/shared_types.py#L18) object which you can play around to add more checks to your tests.

After you have written your tests, you can run them all by executing the `pytest` command from your terminal.

```bash
pytest
```

Using the above steps, you can always test your typegraph whenever you need to. 

While `pytest` is used in this example, typegraphs can be easily tested with most of other test suite solutions by following the above approach.
