# Write REST endpoints

The root materializers, the ones we expose from our typegraphs, are served through a GraphQl API over HTTP.
In addition, we can also expose [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) APIs using the `rest` method. 
The method takes GraphQl queries and provides RESTly endpoints for them. 

<SDKTabs>
    <TabItem value="typescript">

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/example_rest.ts").content}</CodeBlock>

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="python">

<CodeBlock language="python">{require("../../../../examples/typegraphs/example_rest.py").content}</CodeBlock>

    </TabItem>
</SDKTabs>

The effect of the root materializer accessed in the query determines the HTTP verb used and the mapping can be found [here](/docs/reference/types/functions#effects). 

There's also an OpenAPI schema generated from the rest endpoints served under `{typegate_url}/{typegraph}/rest/_schema`. 
A browser based explorer for the OpenAPI schema is served under `{typegate_url}/{typegraph}/rest` as well.
