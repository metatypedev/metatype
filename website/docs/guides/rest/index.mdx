# Write REST endpoints

The root functions, the ones we expose from our typegraphs, are served through a GraphQl API over HTTP.
In addition, we can also expose [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) APIs using the `rest` method. 
The method takes GraphQl queries and provides RESTly endpoints for them. 

<TGExample
  python={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/example_rest.py")}
  typescript={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/example_rest.ts")}
  disablePlayground
/>

The effect of the root function accessed in the query determines the HTTP verb used, and the mapping can be found [here](/docs/reference/types/functions#effects). 

There's also an OpenAPI schema generated from the rest endpoints served under `{typegate_url}/{typegraph}/rest/_schema`. 
A browser-based explorer for the OpenAPI schema is served under `{typegate_url}/{typegraph}/rest` as well.

You can refer to the [REST reference](/docs/reference/rest) section for more information.
