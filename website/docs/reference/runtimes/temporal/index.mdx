# Temporal

## Temporal runtime

[Temporal](https://temporal.io/) is an open-source durable execution engine that can be used to develop workflows that are long lived and failure resistant.
Common use cases include:

- Implementing multi-step, complicated transactionaly business logic. 
- Guaranteed event processing.
- Control planes for driving processes.

The `TemporalRuntime` in Metatype can be used to directly `start`, `query`, `signal` and `describe` workflows on your temporal cluster. 
Refer to the [temporal docs](https://docs.temporal.io) for more on what you can accomplish with this tech.

An interesting use case is to dynamically describe the operations you want to expose, this enables reusing typegraphs accross different projects or even building a small framework around it.

Here is a simple example of a typegraph that takes some value from an environment variable.


<TGExample
    typegraph="temporal"
    python={require("../../../../../examples/typegraphs/temporal.py")}
    typescript={require("!!code-loader!../../../../../examples/typegraphs/temporal.ts")}
    disablePlayground={true}
    query={{content: ""}}
/>
