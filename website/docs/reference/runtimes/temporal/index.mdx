# Temporal

[Temporal](https://temporal.io/) is an open-source durable execution engine that can be used to develop workflows that are long lived and failure resistant.
Common usecases include:

- Implementing multi-step, complicated transactionaly business logic. 
- Guranteed event processing.
- Control planes for driving processes.

The `TemporalRuntime` in Metatype can be used to directly `start`, `query`, `signal` and `describe` workflows on your temporal cluster. 
Refer to the [temporal docs](https://docs.temporal.io) for more on what you can accomplish with this tech.

<!-- TODO: setup a test temporal cluster and workflow for demo purposes -->
