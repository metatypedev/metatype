# Runtimes

## General overview

The status represents the maturity of the runtime implementation:

- not documented: experiment at your own risk
- alpha: incomplete or non-stabilized API, most features should work you should expect breaking changes likely
- beta: complete and almost-stable API, but still collecting feedbacks and improving usability
- stable: complete and stable API, no breaking changes expected

## Tiers
In total, metatype aims to support 3 types of runtimes, each type corresponding to a tier.

### Tier 1 - Embedded runtimes
User defined runtimes, you can write your own runtime logic and package it along with your typegraph.\
This type of runtime refers to any runtime that uses the materializer development kit, which can be generated from the `meta gen mdk` command.


### Tier 2 - Embedded language runtimes
This type of runtime covers any runtime that uses a sandboxed programming language runtime that you can define custom logic on.

This includes:
- Deno
- Python
- Wasm

### Tier 3 - Specialized runtimes
This refers to any runtime embedded within typegate that performs specialized tasks.

This includes:
- Prisma
- Http
- GraphQL
- Random
- Temporal
- S3
