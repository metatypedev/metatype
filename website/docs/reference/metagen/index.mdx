# Metagen

:::warning Beta

The following feature is not yet stable.

:::

Metagen is a code-generator suite that contains implementations that help with development on the Metatype platform. Today, this means a set of generators to help with [custom functions](/docs/guides/external-functions) by generating types, serializers and bindings. It's availaible bundled within the [meta CLI](/docs/reference/meta-cli) and the [typegraph SDKs](/docs/reference/typegraph#sdks).

## Access through CLI

The meta-cli has a dedicated `gen` command for interacting with metagen. We configure the generators through the [standard configuration file](/docs/reference/meta-cli/configuration-file) under the metagen key.

```yaml
typegates:
  # bla bla

typegraphs:
  # bla bla

metagen:
  targets:
    main:
      # generator to use
      - generator: mdk_rust
        # path to generate to
        path: ./bff/
        # typegraph path to use
        typegraph_path: ./typegraphs/svc-bff.ts
        # we can have multiple generators per target
      - generator: mdk_rust
        path: ./telemetry/
        typegraph_path: ./typegraphs/svc-telemetry.ts
        # generators might have custom keys
        stubbed_runtimes: ["wasm_wire", "deno"]
    # more than one targets avail if you need them
    iter:
      - generator: mdk_typescript
        path: ./ts/
        # name of typegraph to read from typegate
        typegraph: svc_products
```

This allows us to invoke the targets from the CLI.

```sh
meta cli gen main
```

This will resolve the requisite typegraphs, serialize as needed and put the resulting files at the appropriate locations. If no target name is provied, the CLI will look for a target under the key `main` and invoke it instead.

## Access through SDK

Metagen is availaible through the SDK for programmatic access needs and can be helpful when writing tests or when relying on the CLI is not an option.

<TGExample
  python={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/metagen-sdk.py")}
  typescript={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/metagen-sdk.ts")}
  disablePlayground
/>

## Generators

:::info Chicken or the egg?

As most of the generators are intended for types to be used by custom functions, they'll require that you declare the custom functions in your typegraph first. This begs the question, how does one declare custom functions that depend on artifacts that are yet to be generated? Typegraphs error out when referenced artifacts aren't found, how does it work in this scenario?

To resolve this concern, the SDKs support a serialization mode that skips resolution of artifacts. This mode is activated when serialization is done for codegen purposes. What this means is that, **you can declare non-existent files in your typegraph and codegen should work**. Some generators are even smart enough to work around your expected files. Of course, if the files aren't present when you're trying to deply to the typegate, it'll raise an error.

### `mdk_typescript`

This generator supports:

- Typescript types that map to typegraph types
- Stub function types for custom functions implementors that adhere to typegraph functions.
  - By default, all function types from the `DenoRuntime` get stub types.
  - Use `stubbed_runtimes` to select which runtimes get stubs.
- Types for interacting with the typegate from within custom functions.

The following example showcases the generator.

Typegraph:

<TGExample
  python={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/metagen-deno.py")}
  typescript={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/metagen-deno.py")}
  disablePlayground
/>

Custom function:

<TGExample
  typescript={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/metagen/ts/remix.ts")}
  disablePlayground
/>

<details>
  <summary>
  Code generation sample.
  </summary>

  <TGExample
    typescript={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/metagen/ts/mdk.ts")}
    disablePlayground
  />
</details>

It supports the following extra configuration keys.

| Key                | Type       | Default    | Description                                |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `stubbed_runtimes` | `string[]` | `["deno"]` | Runtimes for which to generate stub types. |

### `mdk_python`

This generator supports:

- Python classes that map to typegraph types
- Decorators for custom functions implementors that require adherance to typegraph function types.
  - By default, all functions from the `PythonRuntime` get stub types.
  - TODO: `stubbed_runtimes` for `mdk_python`
- TODO: types for interacting with the typegate from within custom functions.

If the referenced module for the custom function is not found, the generator will also output stub implementation (in addition to the types) at the given type. It will not replace our code on a second run.

The following example showcases the generator.

Typegraph:

<TGExample
  typescript={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/metagen-py.ts")}
  disablePlayground
/>

Custom function:

<TGExample
  python={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/metagen/py/remix.py")}
  disablePlayground
/>

  <summary>

  <TGExample
    python={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/metagen/py/remix_types.py")}
    disablePlayground
  />
</details>

### `mdk_rust`

This generator generates types, serializers and bindings needed to implement custom functions in Rust. Rust implementations will need to be compiled to wasm components to be executed on the metatype platform and the generator assumes such usage.

To be more specific, it supports:

- Rust types that map to typegraph defined types
  - Serialization is handled out of sight through [`serde_json`](https://lib.rs/serde_json)
- Stub traits for custom functions implementors that adhere to typegraph functions.
  - By default, all functions from the `WasmRuntime` get stub types.
  - The generator assumes the `wire` based wasm interface is being targetted.
  - `stubbed_runtimes` key can be used to configure stub generation from additional runtimes.
- Types for interacting with the typegate from within custom functions.
- Glue code for setting up the wasm component to be run within the `WasmRuntime`.

By default the generator will also output a library crate entrypoint and a functional Cargo.toml with all the required dependencies. These additional files wlil not be overwritten on a second run. The generator can also be configured to avoid generating them even if not present.

The following example showcases the generator.

Typegraph:

<TGExample
  python={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/metagen-rs.py")}
  typescript={require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/metagen-rs.ts")}
  disablePlayground
/>

Custom function:

<CodeBlock language="rust">
  {
    require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/metagen/rs/lib.rs")
      .content
  }
</CodeBlock>

<details>
  <summary>Code generation sample.</summary>
  <CodeBlock language="rust">
    {
      require("!!code-loader!../../../../examples/typegraphs/metagen/rs/mdk.rs")
        .content
    }
  </CodeBlock>
</details>

It supports the following extra configuration keys.

| Key                | Type       | Default                | Description                                           |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `stubbed_runtimes` | `string[]` | `["wasm_wire"]`        | Runtimes for which to generate stub types.            |
| `crate_name`       | `string`   | `${typegraphName}_mdk` | Name to assign to crate when generating `Cargo.toml`. |
| `skip_cargo_toml`  | `boolean`  | `false`                | Do not generate `Cargo.toml`.                         |
| `skip_lib_rs`      | `boolean`  | `false`                | Do not generate `lib.rs`, the sample entrypoint.      |
