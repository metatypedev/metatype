# Configuration file

## `metatype.yml` Example file

The `metatype.yml` is a configuration file where we store environment variables, secrets and configs in which our app will use during deployment and runtime. You can set different variables your app depends on. By default, you need to specify the `typegates` where your `typegraphs` will be deployed.

```yaml
typegates:
  dev:
    url: http://localhost:7890
    username: admin
    password: password
    secrets:
      my-app:
        POSTGRES_URL: postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/db?schema=public

typegraphs:
  python:
    include: "**/*.py"
  materializers:
    prisma:
      migrations_path: "migrations"
```

## Typegate configuration

Each typegate node is configured under `typegates.<name>`.
The typegate node selection is done by the `--target` option in the CLI.

### Named secrets

Named secrets are used to configure runtimes.
Their values are provided in the `secrets` section of the configuration file
directly or indirectly using [lade](https://github.com/zifeo/lade).
Each entry in the `secrets` section is the set of secrets for a specific typegraph.
The typegraph name is the key of the entry and the value is an object mapping each secret name to its value or vault source (see [next section](#automatic-secret-loading-support)).

To sum up, each secret is defined in `secrets.<typegraph-name>.<secret-name>.<secret-value-or-source>`.

## Automatic secret loading support

[Lade](https://github.com/zifeo/lade) is a secret loading tool that transparently inject environment variables from a variety of sources. It works with Fish, Bash or Zsh and currently supports Doppler, Infisical and 1Password as vault source.

To use Lade with Metatype, you can use the `op://`, `infisical://` or `doppler://` prefixes in your configuration file. It will then use the CLI of the vault to securely load the required secrets. For example:

```
typegates:
  dev:
    url: http://localhost:7890
    username: op://VAULT_NAME/SECRET_NAME/FIELD_NAME
    password: infisical://app.infisical.com/PROJECT_NAME/ENV_NAME/SECRET_NAME
```
