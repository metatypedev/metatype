# Configuration file

## `metatype.yml` Example file

```yaml
typegates:
  dev:
    url: http://localhost:7890
    username: admin
    password: password
    secrets:
      my-app:
        POSTGRES_URL: postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/db?schema=public

typegraphs:
  python:
    include: "**/*.py"
  materializers:
    prisma:
      migrations_path: "migrations"
```

## Typegate configuration

Each typegate node is configured under `typegates.<name>`.
The typegate node selection is done by the `--target` option in the CLI.

### Named secrets

Named secrets are used to configure runtimes.
Their values are provided in the `secrets` section of the configuration file
directly or indirectly using [lade](https://github.com/zifeo/lade).
Each entry in the `secrets` section is the set of secrets for a specific typegraph.
The typegraph name is the key of the entry and the value is an object mapping each secret name to its value or vault source (see [next section](#automatic-secret-loading-support)).

To sum up, each secret is defined in `secrets.<typegraph-name>.<secret-name>.<secret-value-or-source>`.

## Automatic secret loading support

[Lade](https://github.com/zifeo/lade) is a secret loading tool that transparently inject environment variables from a variety of sources. It works with Fish, Bash or Zsh and currently supports Doppler, Infisical and 1Password as vault source.

To use Lade with Metatype, you can use the `op://`, `infisical://` or `doppler://` prefixes in your configuration file. It will then use the CLI of the vault to securely load the required secrets. For example:

```
typegates:
  dev:
    url: http://localhost:7890
    username: op://VAULT_NAME/SECRET_NAME/FIELD_NAME
    password: infisical://app.infisical.com/PROJECT_NAME/ENV_NAME/SECRET_NAME
```
