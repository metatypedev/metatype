## Automatic secret loading support

[Lade](https://github.com/zifeo/lade) is a secret loading tool that transparently inject environment variables from a variety of sources. It works with Fish, Bash or Zsh and currently supports Doppler, Infisical and 1Password as vault source.

To use Lade with Metatype, you can use the `op://`, `infisical://` or `doppler://` prefixes in your configuration file. It will then use the CLI of the vault to securely load the required secrets. For example:

```
typegates:
  dev:
    url: http://localhost:7890
    username: op://VAULT_NAME/SECRET_NAME/FIELD_NAME
    password: infisical://app.infisical.com/PROJECT_NAME/ENV_NAME/SECRET_NAME
```
