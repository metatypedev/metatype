# Rate limiting

The rate limiting algorithm works as follows:

- each function type can either count the # of calls it gets or the # of results returned `rate_calls=False`
- each function type can have a weight `rate_weight=1`
- each request is identified by its IP or by one value of its context if set `context_identifier`
- a single query can score a maximum of `query_limit`
- multiple queries can sum up to `window_limit` in a `window_sec` window
- when there is multiple typegates (`N`), you can improve performance by avoiding score synchronizing while the typegate has not reached `local_excess`: the real maximum score is thus `window_limit + min(local_excess, query_limit) * N`

<TGExample
  typegraph="rate"
  python={require("./rate.py")}
  query={require("./rate.graphql")}
/>

Playing with the above should allow you to quickly hit the limits.
