# CORS

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on the one hand is a mechanism that allows or denies cross-origin requests in the browser. It avoids that other websites use your API without explicitly allowing it. Note that it doesn't protect other servers or a mobile app from using your typegraphs, only browsers implements the CORS mechanism. See this [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) for the details.

<TGExample
  typegraph="cors"
  python={require("../../../../typegraphs/cors.py")}
  query={require("./cors.graphql")}
/>

If your browser support well CORS, you should see an error and even more if you try to run the interactive demo. By the way, there is a hidden core header in all interactive demos you have met so far:

```python
TypeGraph.Cors(allow_origin=["https://metatype.dev", "http://localhost:3000"])
```
