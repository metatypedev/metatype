# Synchronization

The typegate run in either on of the following modes:
- _Single instance mode:_ a single typegate instance runs all the workloads;
- _Synchronized mode:_ the workloads can be shared accross multiple typegate instances.

## System setup

To enable multiple typegate instance support, the system need the following services:

|Service|Role|
|---------|----|
|Load balancer|Share the loads accross the different typegate instances|
|Redis database|Used for synchronization between typegate instances|
|S3 storage|Store all the shared files/artifacts for the typegate instances|
|Typegate instances|_Obvious_|

### Load balancer

The setup does not require a specific load balancer software/hardware.
Any load balancer can do the job.

### Redis database

A single redis instance can be shared by multiple systems, configured with
different database numbers.


### S3 storage

Any S3-compatible object store is supported for the file/artifact storage.

One S3 storage might be shared by multiple systems.
However, each system must be configured to use its own dedicated bucket.

### Typegate instances

The typegate instances are configured with environment variables.
All the instances of the system must share the same value
for the synchronization variables.

See [configuration](#typegate-configuration) for details.

## Typegate configuration

The typegate instances that at the core of the system must share
the configuration variables.

Synchronization variable names start with `SYNC_`.

:::warning
- If no `SYNC_*` variable is present, the typegate will run in the default
single instance mode.
- The typegate will fail to start if any of the `SYNC_*` variables is present
and some required `SYNC_*` variable is missing.
:::

|Variable|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|SYNC_REDIS_URL (_Required_)|URL to the Redis database. Must include the database number.|
|SYNC_REDIS_PASSWORD (_Optional_)|Redis database password, can be included in SYNC_REDIS_URL;|
|SYNC_S3_HOST (_Required_)|Hostname of the S3 store;|
|SYNC_S3_REGION (_Required_)|S3 region;|
|SYNC_S3_ACCESS_KEY (_Required_)|Access key for the S3 store credentials;|
|SYNC_S3_SECRET_KEY (_Required_)|Access key secret for the S3 store credentials;|
|SYNC_S3_PATH_STYLE (_Optional_)|`true` or `false`, force path style if `true`.|
|SYNC_S3_BUCKET (_Required_)|The bucket to be used for the system (dedicated).|
