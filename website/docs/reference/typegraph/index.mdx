# Typegraph

Typegraphs are a the main building blocks when we write an app using Metatype. 
The unit of development and deployment.
Think microservices if you will but they're more than a deployment approach to code. 
They're composed with sets of types, their relation to each other, their relation to external types/APIs, the functions on these types, the details of how these functions are exposed to the world and more.

## SDK

The typegates only know of and accept typegraphs in their serialized format.
But for authoring typegraphs, we make use of SDK libraries available in different languages.
