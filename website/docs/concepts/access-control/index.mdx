# Access control

Typegraphs allow you to specify granular access control when exposing your materializers.
This can be done at the materializer or the type field level.
[Policy-based-access-control](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/policy_based_access_control) is the primary paradigm [implemented](/docs/reference/policies) in Metatype today.
