## Why does Metatype exists?

> Products in this paragraph refer indistinctly to a project, a product, a start-up idea or a company.

At the age where:

- everything is an API
- composition is the new oil
- iterating domain and system together
- developer resources are scarce

As your product evolves, the technological stack becomes a challenging place where initiatives collides and efficiency struggles. Especially:

- interoperability
- validating data objects at multiple levels (e.g. front, back, storage, underlying services)
- hiring talented engineers become a [bottleneck](https://martinfowler.com/articles/bottlenecks-of-scaleups/02-talent.html)
- new API or data consumers arise (e.g. new partner/team/tools)
- technical debt become unhealthy [topics](https://martinfowler.com/articles/bottlenecks-of-scaleups/01-tech-debt.html)
- new features expand features and the modelling domains
- constrained technological progress and innovation by current state
- complexity and frictions decrease [developer experience](https://martinfowler.com/articles/developer-effectiveness.html)
- security and observability needs widen

Offer a paradigm shift.

## How does Metatype work?

Metatype provides an abstraction layer to enable API composition and tackle with agility the above scenarii.

| How (logic)          | server code        | compose with [materializers](#materializers) |
| What (content)       | server defined     | client selects from [types](#types)          |
| Where (execution)    | single environment | orchestrate [runtimes](#runtimes)            |
| Who (authentication) | hard-coded rules   | controlled by [policies](#policies)          |
