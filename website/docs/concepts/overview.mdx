## What is Metatype ?

Metatype is a **composition ecosystem** for developers. It allows to build automonous, discoverable and modular API blocks on serverless orchestration.
These building blocks enable developers to iterate faster, remain agile as the stack grow and focus on interfaces rather than implementations.

The ecosystem consists of the following parts:

- [**Typegraph**](typegraph): a package to describe graphs of types, runtimes, policies and compositions
- [**Typegate**](typegate): a fast and secure API-agnostic gateway
- [**Meta**](meta): a CLI for augmented coding and deployment
