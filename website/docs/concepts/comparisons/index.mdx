# Comparing Metatype

Metatype foundations takes inspiration from many innovative tools that arose in the last years. We took the best of each of them and combined them into a single engine backed by a convenient [computing model](/docs/reference/typegraph).

While this provides a unique and powerful platform, it can be difficult to understand how exactly Metatype compares to other tools. This page provides a high-level overview of these differences.

## Development platforms

- Firebase
- Supabase
- Hasura
- PostGraphile

These are great platforms to quickly start a new project. However, they hardly scale in terms of architecture evolution, technology freedom, number of developers on the project, and you will eventually have to move out due to increasing costs or iterations slowness.

**When to choose Metatype**

1. You want to build modular APIs by composing pre-defined blocks and import the ones you need from existing systems.
2. You want to take advantage of developers tooling you are familiar with like version controls or multiple environments.
3. You favor interoperability and extensibility over vendor lock-in and follow your future needs with ease.
4. You want to decouple your database from your API and change where the data is stored as the project evolves.

## Headless CMS

- Strapi
- Directus

Headless Content Management Systems (CMS) are great tools to manage content and providing great editing experience. However, they are not designed to build complex APIs like a cart checkout or integrate with other systems.

**When to choose Metatype**

1. You want an all-in-one APIs development platforms and offer the same editing experience through a user-friendly interface
2. You care about end-user performance and want to use the best underlying technology for each use cases
3. You are more than one on the project and want to manage your data models using preferred programming language


## Low Code Platforms

- Retool
- Airtable
- Windmill

Low Code platforms are a game changer when it comes to faster development cycle, great collaboration options and the gentle learning curve. However, this comes at the cost of losing degree of flexibility and cusomizability. They are also hard to apply different scalability and come with limited performance optimization. 

**When to choose Metatype**

1. When you want to implement modular APIs and backends with instantaneous responses
2. When you want to interact with workflow engines and control over the operations they perform, including pooling and retries
3. When you look for a serverless deployment solution and want to focus on your business logic
