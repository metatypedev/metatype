# Typegate

The typegate nodes - or shorter, typegates - are the central component of the ecosystems. They build and verify typegraphs, and expose them through a GraphQL interface. They enforce the type safety of the data flows, connect to all the runtimes and orchestrate the execution of incoming requests.

## Request lifecycle

When a new request fires a trigger, the typegate orchestrates the following stages:

1. extract the secure request context from custom authentication or JSON Web Token (JWT)
1. retrieve cached execution plan or compute a new one
   - traverse the typegraph to create a DAG of the required types
   - optimize the DAG to reduce the number of calls to the runtimes
   - pre-compute all structural elements and data resolutions
1. execute the plan
   - type check the arguments
   - verify lazily policies on the need
   - run the DAG execution
   - enforce the rate-limiting
   - type check the response
1. manage metadata of the request

## HTTP/GraphQL interface

For now, the typegate nodes are only accessible through HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. More protocols could be supported in the future. Typegates expose a GraphQL interface which is the result of a [typegraph](./typegraph) projected onto corresponding GraphQL types. While this reduces the type safety of the data flowing, it makes more interoperable thanks to the many high-quality and well-known GraphQL tooling already available. The underlying types are also exposed in order for API clients to verify the underlying types.

GraphQL, being a query language, offers a great asset for Metatype's philosophy:

1. Efficient querying: the client can specify exactly what data it needs, reducing the amount of over- or under-fetching
2. Flexibility: allows for retrieving multiple resources in a single request, unlike REST, which often requires multiple ones
3. Typing: GraphQL has a built-in type system that allows for better documentation and stronger validation of the requests
4. Improved tooling: tools and libraries around GraphQL are rapidly growing and great a development experience
