# Meta CLI

`meta` is a command line interface for interacting with the typegate and provide a simple, yet complete, developer experience. The `metatype.yml` file allows you to configure your environment and CLI settings, see [configuration file](../reference/meta-cli/configuration-file).

## Development

It watches for changes in your typegraphs and refresh your development typegate node on the fly.

## Deployment

It deploy your typegraph to the Metatype Cloud or your self-hosted typegate instances in a single command.
